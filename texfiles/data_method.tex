\section{Numerical models}
\label{sec:model-des}

Numerical models such as the APECOSM model used here are valuable tools to understand the mechanisms that drive the response of oceanic ecosystems to ENSO variability. They usually require physical and biogeochemical forcings (temperature, oxygen, low-trophic levels) as an input. In the present study, we use outputs from a coupled physical and biogeochemical simulation, which is described in \ref{sec:nemo} section. The ecosystem simulation is discussed in \ref{sec:apecosm}.

%\section{Data and method}
%
%In the present section, the different observation-based datasets used in this study to validate the numerical models are presented. 
%
%%and statistical tools used in this study are presented.

%\subsection{Sea-level anomalies}
%\label{sec:ssh}
%
%Observation-based sea-level anomalies are obtained from the reprocessed Global Ocean Gridded L4 Sea-Surface Heights\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148}} data, provided by the Copernicus Climate Service as monthly values on a regular $0.25 \times 0.25$ grid from 1993-01 to 2020-12. This product was built by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system, which processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. Using along-track altimeter data, gridded sea-level anomalies are extracted by using an Optimal Interpolation off all the flying satellites. 
%
%%For our study, a monthly sea-level climatology was computed from 1993 to 2018 and used to extract monthly sea-level anomalies, which have been detrended.
%
%\subsection{Chlorophyll}
%\label{sec:chl}
%
%Chlorophyll observation-based estimates are extracted from the monthly OceanColour-CCI V5 CHL-a dataset\footnote{\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/1dbe7a109c0244aaad713e078fd3059a}} \citep{sathyendranathOceanColourTimeSeries2019} over the 1997-09/2018-12 period. For our purpose, the high resolution dataset (4 km) has been regridded on a regular $1\times 1$ grid by computing weighted chlorophyll averages over $24\times24$ boxes, with the weights being provided by the cosine of latitude. When more than $1/3$ of the data used in the averaging is missing, the regridded cell is masked. 
%
%%The monthly climatology has then been computed over the 1998-2008 period and used to extract monthly anomalies, which have then been detrended.
%
%\subsection{Fish biomass estimates}
%\label{sec:fish}
%
%Fish biomass estimates are extracted from the IRD Level 2 global monthly catch of tuna, tuna-like and shark species dataset\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1164128}} \citep{taconetGlobalMonthlyCatch2018}. First, the purse-seine captures of skipjack and yellowfin tunas have been extracted from the raw input file. Then, non-monthly observations (i.e. when the difference between the end and start dates exceed 31 days) have been discarded, as well as those which are unlocalized. Finally, the remaining observations have been regridded into on a regular $1 \times 1$ grid using the overlapping area between the observation polygon and the destination cell. The final product is a $3D$ array of dimensions (time and space) that extends from 1959 to 2016. However, due to the early poor data coverage, this dataset was used from 1985 onward.
%
%%\subsection{Covariance analysis}
%%\label{sec:cov}
%%
%%In order to assess the spatial signature of ENSO variability on physical, biogeochemical and biological variables, covariance analysis is used. For each grid cell, the monthly climatology of the analysed fields is removed, and the resulting monthly anomalies are detrended. Finally, the covariance between the detrended anomalies and the ONI index is computed. The resulting map can be interpreted as the monthly anomalies associated with an ONI value of 1.
%%%Correlations are computed in the same way. 
%%%Their significance has been inferred using a Student t-test, in which the effective number of degrees of freedom has been corrected based on the 1-lag autocorrelation of the 2 two time-series \citep{brethertonEffectiveNumberSpatial1999}.
