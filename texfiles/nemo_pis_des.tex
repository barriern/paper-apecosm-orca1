\subsection{Physical and biogeochemical model}
\label{sec:nemo}

The three-dimensional physical and biogeochemical fields required to run APECOSM are extracted from an oceanic simulation performed with the physical ocean model NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, \citealp{madecNEMOOceanEngine2019}) coupled to the ocean biogeochemical model PISCES (Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies, \citealp{aumontPISCESv2OceanBiogeochemical2015}). 

NEMO simulates the dynamics and thermodynamics of the physical ocean. Prognostic variables are
the three-dimensional velocity field, a non-linear sea surface height, the
conservative temperature and the absolute salinity, distributed on a three-dimensional Arakawa C-type grid. Density is computed from potential temperature, salinity and pressure using the \cite{iocInternationalThermodynamicEquation2010} equation of state. Vertical mixing is parameterized from a turbulence closure scheme based on a prognostic vertical turbulent kinetic equation, which has been shown to perform well in the tropics before \citep{blankeVariabilityTropicalAtlantic1993}. Lateral mixing acts along isopycnal surfaces, with a Laplacian operator and $200 m^2 s^{-1}$ constant isopycnal diffusivity coefficient \citep{lengaigneImpactIsopycnalMixing2003}. Shortwave fluxes penetrate into the ocean based on a single exponential profile \citep{paulsonIrradianceMeasurementsUpper1977} corresponding to oligotrophic water (attenuation depth of 23 m). 

PISCES is a biogeochemical model of intermediate complexity with 24 prognostic variables designed for global ocean applications \citep{aumontPISCESv2OceanBiogeochemical2015}. It simulates the biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and the main nutrients controlling phytoplankton growth (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, silicic acid, and iron) and the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems, distinguishing four plankton functional types based on size: two phytoplankton groups ("small phytoplankton" -e.g. nanophytoplankton- and "large phytoplankton" -e.g. diatoms-) and two zooplankton groups ("small zooplankton" -e.g. microzooplankton- and "large zooplankton" -e.g. mesozooplankton-). It also includes small and large particulate organic matter.

The NEMO-PISCES simulation used in this study is deployed on the tripolar ORCA1 grid \citep{madecGlobalOceanMesh1996}, with a 1\degree{} nominal horizontal resolution and a refined 1/3\degree{} meridional resolution in the equatorial band. Its vertical resolution ranges from 1m at the surface to 100m at 1 kilometer depth and varies over time, following \cite{levierFreeSurfaceVariable2007}. This simulation  is forced over the period 1958-2018 with atmospheric inputs from the JRA atmospheric reanalysis \citep{kobayashiJRA55ReanalysisGeneral2015}, which is representative of  surface atmospheric variability observed over the historical period. 

%Temperature, ocean transports, oxygen, plankton concentration (diatoms, mesozooplankton and microzooplankton, big particulate organic matter), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the layer thickness from this simulation are then used to force the Apecosm ecosystem model.
