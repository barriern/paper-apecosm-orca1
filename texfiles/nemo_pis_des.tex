\subsection{Physical and biogeochemical model}
\label{sec:nemo}

3D physical and biogeochimal fields are extracted from an oceanic simulation performed with the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, \citealt{madecNEMOOceanEngine2019}) dynamical ocean model that includes the biogeochemical component PISCES (Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies, \citealt{aumontPISCESv2OceanBiogeochemical2015}). 

NEMO simulates the dynamics and thermodynamics of the physical ocean. Prognostic variables are
the three-dimensional velocity field, a non-linear sea surface height, the
conservative temperature and the absolute salinity, distributed on a three-dimensional Arakawa C-type grid.

PISCES is a biogeochemical model of intermediate complexity designed for global ocean applications \citep{aumontPISCESv2OceanBiogeochemical2015}, which uses 24 prognostic variables and simulates the biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and the main nutrients controlling phytoplankton growth (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, silicic acid, and iron). It simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems distinguishing four plankton functional types based on size: two phytoplankton groups (small = nanophytoplankton and large = diatoms) and two zooplankton groups (small = microzooplankton and large = mesozooplankton). It also includes small and large particulate organic matter.

The NEMO-PISCES simulation used in this study is deployed on a tripolar ORCA1 grid \citep{madecGlobalOceanMesh1996}, with a 1\degree{} nominal horizontal resolution and a refined 1/3\degree{} meridional resolution in the equatorial band. Its vertical resolution ranges from 1m at the surface to 100m at 1 kilometer depth and varies over time, following \cite{levierFreeSurfaceVariable2007}. It extends from 1958 to 2018 and is forced with atmospheric inputs from the JRA atmospheric reanalysis \citep{kobayashiJRA55ReanalysisGeneral2015}, representative of observed variability over the historical period. 

%Temperature, ocean transports, oxygen, plankton concentration (diatoms, mesozooplankton and microzooplankton, big particulate organic matter), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the layer thickness from this simulation are then used to force the Apecosm ecosystem model.
