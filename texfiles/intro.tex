\section{Introduction}

The paper is organized as follows. The sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll simulated by the coupled physical biogeochemical model will be confronted to observation based datasets, in order to insure that it properly simulates the ocean response to ENSO variability (section \ref{sec:pisces}).
