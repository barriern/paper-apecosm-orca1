\section{Introduction}

%\textbf{Societal relevance.} 
Understanding the impact of climate variability and change on marine ecosystems is key for the countries that border the tropical Pacific and exploit its marine resources. The marine ecosystems in the tropical Pacific Ocean indeed support a variety of small-scale artisanal fisheries that are essential for food security and livelihoods of most tropical Pacific islands and riparian countries \citep{batistaTropicalArtisanalCoastal2014}. They also support domestic and Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFN) large-scale oceanic fleets that are responsible for 60\% of the world's tuna catches and  contribute substantially to the income of most Pacific Island Countries and Territories, through domestic production and the payment of fishing rights (Just in the Western and Central Pacific, the value of the total tuna catch has consistently fluctuated between 4.5 and 7.5 billion dollars since 2007, \citealt{williamsOverviewTunaFisheries2021}). Skipjack (\textit{Katsuwonus pelamis}), yellowfin (\textit{Thunnus albacares}) and young bigeye (\textit{Thunnus obesus}) tunas make up the bulk of purse seine catches that dominate tropical tuna fisheries \citep{allainOverviewTunaFisheries2018}. Their catches generally occur in the warm (above 26°C) surface waters of the western and the eastern Pacific where they live, reproduce and feed opportunistically on a wide range of small planktonic and nektonic epipelagic prey. Indeed, the prevailing trade wind conditions in the tropical Pacific leads to the accumulation of warm waters in the western Pacific that are favorable to tropical tuna. These winds also cause an upwelling of cold and rich waters along the equator throughout the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and induce the accumulation of epipelagic tuna prey that are part of trophic chains resulting from the equatorial upwelling. Smaller quantities of yellowfin and bigeye tuna as well as the temperate albacore tuna (\textit{Thunnus alalunga}) are also caught by industrial longliners in sub-equatorial and sub-tropical regions \citep{allainOverviewTunaFisheries2018}.

%\textbf{ENSO physical and biogeochemical response.} 
The climatological distribution of tropical tuna is strongly altered by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Earth’s most energetic year-to-year climate event \citep{williamsOverviewTunaFisheries2014, caiChangingNinoSouthern2021}. ENSO indeed has a significant impact on the physical and biogeochemical properties of the tropical Pacific Ocean. 
An El Niño event (i.e. the warm phase of ENSO) is characterized by a  deepening of the thermocline and nutricline in the central and eastern Pacific, which causes a warming of sea surface temperatures and a reduction of primary production in these regions, via a reduction of the upward vertical flux of nutrients and cold waters (e.g. \citealp{chavezBiologicalChemicalResponse1999, murtuguddeOceanColorVariability1999}). In contrast, the western Pacific Ocean is experiencing opposite changes with a shoaling of the thermocline and nutricline, resulting in a slight cooling. Zonal eastward advection of warm nutrient‐poor waters by anomalous eastward currents also contributes to the decrease of biological productivity in the central Pacific (e.g. \citealp{chavezBiologicalChemicalResponse1999, picautOceanicZoneConvergence2001}). La Niña (i.e. the cold ENSO phase) are generally considered as a mirror image of El Niño, despite some asymmetric features.  

%\textbf{Synchronous ecological response to ENSO.}
These changes in the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of the tropical Pacific Ocean during ENSO ultimately affect high trophic level organisms, including exploited fish populations, through changes in habitat conditions (oxygen, temperature, light penetration), currents and food abundance and availability \citep{bertrandNinoSouthernOscillation2020}.  Tuna fisheries data indicate that purse seine catches in the western Pacific generally move eastward during El Niño events and retract  westward during La Niña events, in conjunction with the zonal migration of the warm pool \citep{lehodeyNinoSouthernOscillation1997}. The strength of the vertical temperature gradients at the thermocline level also exerts a strong control on the vertical distribution of tunas \citep[e.g.][]{schaeferMovementsBehaviorHabitat2002}. It vertically compresses their thermal and feeding habitat in the western Pacific during El Niño, which increases the formations of dense schools \citep{mauryCanSchoolingRegulate2017} thus promoting their catchability by purse seine fisheries \citep{bertrandHydrologicalTrophicCharacteristics2002}. ENSO not only impacts ecosystems through horizontal and vertical movements of fish populations, but can also affect the survival of larvae, whose variability propagates through the population structure and may be detected after a time lag in the adult populations \citep{yenSpatialTemporalVariations2016, kimEffectsClimateinducedVariation2015}. 

%\textbf{Ecosystem modelling.} 
Most of the observational studies analyzing the influence of ENSO on Pacific marine ecosystems rely on tuna catch data, the variation of which is not only controlled by climate variability effects on population abundance and distribution but also by changes in fishing effort distribution and catchability and various dynamical processes internal to the ecosystem \citep{hobdayDetectingClimateImpacts2013}. In addition, these fisheries observations are heterogeneous, limited to narrow and varying gear-specific depth ranges (for instance the 0-150m surface layer for purse seine data), focused on a few species and small size ranges, so that potential climate signals in these data are likely to be biased and distorted by other factors \citep{hobdayDetectingClimateImpacts2013}. In complement to using fisheries observations, several ecosystem models have been developed as part of the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP, \citealp{tittensorProtocolIntercomparisonMarine2018}) to characterize and understand marine ecosystem responses to climate fluctuations. These models have been used primarily to project biomass changes in response to global warming, generally pointing to a global decline of marine biomass, more pronounced for higher trophic levels and tropical waters \citep{lotzeGlobalEnsembleProjections2019, tittensorNextgenerationEnsembleProjections2021}. While these models are now commonly used to project future  changes in biomass, they are much less used to analyze their response to past climate variability. This is however necessary because (1) a reliable representation of past variations in fish biomass would improve confidence in the reliability in their future projections and (2) a better understanding of the processes responsible for past variability would provide keys to improving the models and better understanding future changes. To our knowledge, only the SEAPODYM \citep{lehodeySpatialEcosystemPopulations2008} ecosystem model has been specifically used to assess the ecosystem response to ENSO in the tropical Pacific, focusing on the spatial dynamics of the skipjack population \citep{lehodeyPelagicEcosystemTropical2001}. This model is able to reproduce the large-scale zonal migration of the skipjack tuna population in the equatorial Pacific in response to ENSO, which they attribute to ENSO-related changes in temperature, prey and oxygen concentrations that are driving active movements of skipjack tuna. Analysis of this model also suggests that El Niño not only drives an eastward tuna displacement but also promotes  strong larval recruitment \citep{seninaParameterEstimationBasinscale2008}. 
However, most ecosystem models have certain limitations that may restrict their ability to capture the full complexity of ENSO's impact on ecosystems. In particular, they generally simulate the marine ecosystem in two dimensions, despite the  inherently three-dimensional nature of the impacts of El Niño events on the physical and biogeochemical oceanic properties  (shoaling/weakening of the thermocline and the relation with oxygen for instance; \citealp{leungENSODrivesNearsurface2019}). They also generally do not consider the effect of passive transport by ocean currents or active movements along environmental gradients and when they do, this transport is applied  to only a limited number of size or age classes. Furthermore, they rarely simultaneously include  the bottom-up and top-down effects of predation as well as the various metabolic processes (growth, reproduction, development, maintenance, mortality) that contribute to the transfer and dissipation of energy along food chains and cause temporal changes characteristic of environmental variability. 

The objective of this paper is to revisit the question of ENSO impacts on tropical Pacific Ocean ecosystems using the mechanistic ecosystem model APECOSM (\citealp{mauryOverviewAPECOSMSpatialized2010}), which doesn't suffer from most of the limitations highlighted above and which considers explicitly the associated bio-ecological complexity. We focus our analysis on understanding the different bio-ecological processes by which ENSO influences the epipelagic community, which is  the most intensively exploited pelagic community, especially by industrial purse seine fisheries targeting skipjack and yellowfin tunas. Overall, we show that the role of passive transport through El Nino related surface current anomalies is critical, not only for small organisms as usually assumed, but also for medium and large organisms. Furthermore, while passive transport effects dominate biomass changes for large organisms, we show that they can be amplified or offset for medium and small organisms by the interplay of bio-ecological processes such as temperature effects on growth, foraging success, and predatory mortality, in ways that differ in the western and central Pacific. Contrary to what is often assumed (e.g. \citealt{lehodeyPelagicEcosystemTropical2001, lehodeyENSOImpactMarine2020}), our model shows that active habitat-based movements are not required to explain the westward biomass shifts that are observed during ENSO.
The document is organized as follows. The section \ref{sec:model-des}) first describes the physical, biogeochemical and ecosystem models used in this study. The section \ref{sec:model-val} then assesses the ability of these models to reproduce the response to ENSO variability by comparing them to observations. The section \ref{sec:nino-epi} then investigates the dynamical and biological processes responsible for the modeled response of epipelagic fish biomass to El Niño events as a function of the size class. Finally, the section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this study by highlighting the main results, limitations and perspectives of this work. 

%Improving our understanding of how climate variability impacts marine ecosystems and  how this will change in the future is a critical issue for the countries bordering the tropical Pacific and harvesting its marine resources. Marine ecosystems in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) are indeed supporting major oceanic fisheries that are responsible for 60% of the world tuna catches, nearly 3 million metric tons worth almost $7 billion each year and they substantially contribute to the revenue of most Pacific Island Countries and Territories. They also underpin a variety of small-scale artisanal fisheries that are critical for food security and livelihood in most tropical Pacific islands. Small-scale fleets operate in the coastal waters of the tropical Pacific States while industrial purse-seine, pole-and-line and long-line fleets operate both in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and in international waters. Highly migratory top-predators such as the tropical skipjack and yellowfin tunas (Katsuwonus pelamis and Thunnus albacares) constitute the bulk of the catch in the WCPO region. They are mostly harvested by industrial purse seine fisheries in the equatorial zone (10\degree{}N-10\degree{}S), where they inhabit and reproduce in warm surface waters above 26\degree{}C and feed opportunistically on a wide range of small epipelagic planktonic and nektonic prey. Smaller quantities of the tropical skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tunas (Thunnus obesus) and the temperate albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) are also taken by industrial longliners in the WCPO up to 20\degree{}N for bigeye and 20\degree{}S for albacore. \\ 
%
%The spatial distribution of purse seine catches in the WCPO is strongly influenced by ENSO events, with catches typically expanding to the east during El Niño years and shifting back to the west during La Niña years (Williams and Terawasi 2014). 
%The ocean physics, biogeochemistry and biology are tightly coupled in the tropical Pacific, which makes it an ideal region to study biophysical interactions. This oceanic region is characterized by prevalent trade wind conditions, which accumulate a pool of warm water in the western equatorial Pacific and induce an upwelling of cold nutrient-rich subsurface waters that cools the entire central and eastern equatorial Pacific. The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) upwelling of, leading to an oligotrophic west Pacific warm pool and a mesotrophic, upwelling cold tongue (e.g., Le Borgne et al. 2002). \warn{INCLUDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN EPIPELAGIC FISH DISTRIBUTION IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC.}
%
%The tropical Pacific is also home to the most energetic earth’s year-to-year climate variations, the El Niño/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Cai et al., 2015). This phenomenon affects climate worldwide through atmospheric teleconnections (Taschetto et al., 2020), causing droughts and floods (Goddard and Gershunov 2020), modulating globally-averaged annual surface air temperature, tropical cyclone activity (Lin et al., 2020) and impacting agriculture and ecosystems  worldwide (Bertrand et al., 2020; Holbrook et al., 2020).  An El Niño event, the warm phase of ENSO, develops as the result of a positive ocean–atmosphere feedback that was first suggested by Bjerknes (1969). In this positive feedback loop, an anomalously warm sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the central/eastern Pacific promotes enhanced deep atmospheric convection and westerly wind anomalies in the central Pacific (Gill, 1980). This wind anomaly drives anomalous eastward surface currents that pushes the warm pool eastward and a deepening of the thermocline in the equatorial central/eastern Pacific, which both reinforce the initial warming. An El Niño event generally starts in late spring, peak at the end of the calendar year and recede during the following winter. La Niña (i.e. the cold ENSO phase) can broadly be viewed as a mirror image of El Niño despite some asymmetrical features: El Niño events can indeed occasionally reach much larger amplitudes than La Niña events, like in 1982, 1997 and 2015.  \\
%
%ENSO not only strongly impacts the physical properties of the tropical Pacific Ocean but also its biogeochemical properties. The dominant mode of global primary production anomalies as estimated from satellites is indeed directly related to ENSO (e.g. Behrenfeld et al., 2006; Chavez et al., 2010; Méssié and Chavez, 2012), with the strongest imprint in the tropical regions. These biological changes during ENSO are largely driven by changes in nutrient supply through vertical nutricline movements and horizontal advective processes (e.g. Barber and Chavez, 1983; Chavez et al. 1999; Wilson and Adamec, 2001; Christian et al., 2002; Ryan et al. 2002), other processes such as changes in stratification or light availability being of secondary importance. El Niño events are generally characterized by a productivity decrease in the eastern and central Pacific and an increase in the western Pacific (Chavez et al. 1999; Murtugudde et al. 1999; Gierach et al., 2012; Radenac et al., 2012). This productivity increase in the eastern equatorial Pacific have been related to a reduction of upward vertical nutrient flux in response to the equatorial thermocline/nutricline depth deepening observed during El Niño events, while the opposite stands in the western equatorial Pacific (e.g., Chavez et al., 1999; Wilson and Adamec, 2001; Radenac et al., 2012). In addition, the zonal eastward advection of nutrient‐poor warm pool waters by anomalous eastward currents further contributes to the decrease in biological productivity in the central Pacific (e.g. Chavez et al., 1999; Picaut et al., 2001). During La Nina events, enhanced equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific lifts deep nutrients into the photic zone, resulting in sometimes spectacular large-scale phytoplankton blooms throughout the cold tongue (e.g. Chavez et al., 1999; Ryan et al., 2002; Gorgues et al., 2010). ENSO not only affects productivity in the equatorial Pacific region but also along the south American west coast. Equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves during El Niño events propagate along this coast as coastally-trapped downwelling Kelvin waves,  inducing a deepening of the thermocline, nutricline and oxycline along the south American coast (Leung et al., 2019)  (Espinoza-Morriberón et al., 2019). \\
%
%These impacts of ENSO variability on the physical and biogeochemical properties of the tropical Pacific ultimately impacts the fish distribution, either through changes in habitat conditions (oxygen, temperature) and/or food availability (Bertrand et al. 2020). For instance, ENSO is known to be a major driver of location and related catches of four prominent tuna species in the Pacific (e.g. Bertrand et al. 2020; Lehodey et al., 2006, Nichols et al., 2014): skipjack (Lehodey et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2020), yellowfin, bigeye (Lu et al. 2001), and albacore (Lu et al. 1998; Kimura et al. 1997; Briand et al., 2011). ENSO directly influences tuna horizontal movements (Lehodey et al., 2020). For example, skipjack tuna catch shift eastward from the western to the central equatorial Pacific during  El  Niño events in response to the eastward migration of the convergence zone at the eastern edge of the warm pool (Lehodey et al., 1997, 2011), where important aggregating mechanisms occur for phytoplantkon (Picaut et al., 2001). El Niño events however generally exert an overall negative influence on relative abundance of skipjack tuna when averaged over the western and central Pacific (Yen et al. 2017). In contrast, the skipjack habitat retracts westward during La Niña events in response to warm pool retraction in the far western Pacific. The extent of the warm pool might also be a good indicator for monitoring the effect of environmental variability on yellowfin tuna recruitment (Kirby et al. 2007). Bigeye tuna has also been reported to extend eastward during El Niño years (Yukinawa, et al., 1988). Prolonged and recurring El Niño increases the effort of finding suitable fishing grounds and leads to decreased tuna harvest being landed in the Philippines (Vera and Hipolito, 2006). This also happened to Taiwan mackerel purse seine fishery, which experienced a sharp decrease in harvest by ~50% during the 1997/1998 El Niño (Sun et al., 2006). The strong temperature gradient of the thermocline exerts a strong control on the vertical tuna habitat (Brill et al., 1999; Schaefer et al., 2002) and its shoaling in the western Pacific during El Niño may squeeze their thermal and feeding vertical habitat, favouring their catchability (Lu et al. 1998; Lehodey et al., 2004). The opposite occurs during La Niña. 
%ENSO may not only affect tuna migration and vertical distribution but also the survival of tuna larvae and, therefore, the abundance of tuna populations. Unfortunately, there are no direct abundance surveys, such as the eggs and larvae sampling commonly used for coastal small pelagic stocks, to monitor such large‐scale variability of tropical tuna species larval densities. However, this variability propagates through the population structure and can be detected with some delay in the exploited stock, either through the analysis of catch rates and size frequencies of catch or as inferred from model and stock assessment analyses. High recruitments of skipjack were for instance reported two to four years following a bloom in the central Pacific, suggesting that La Niña-related high primary productivity is favorable to nursery and feeding conditions (Yen and Lu, 2016). El Niño has also been reported to negatively impact gonad maturation and mean length of skipjack tuna with time lags of 12 and 7 months, respectively (Kim et al. 2015). For long‐living species, such as bigeye and albacore, the decreasing growth rate with age and its natural variability over time and space leads to a cohort (age) signal more and more difficult to detect in larger fish. Therefore, the recruitment variability associated with ENSO, i.e. low or high peaks of abundance in the first cohort, is smoothed and damped while it combines with the internal dynamic processes of the species propagating toward the older cohorts (Lehodey et al., 2010; Sibert et al., 2012; Senina et al., 2017). Despite these issues, catches of albacore have been reported to decrease between 4 to 8 years after an El Niño onset south of 10\degree{}S, a time interval that would be expected before the recruitment for the fish spawned during ENSO episodes (Lu et al., 1998). This negative relationship with El Niño has been hypothesized to be related to the extension of warm waters in the central Pacific during El Niño events which reduces the extent of spawning grounds of south Pacific albacore (Lehodey et al. 2003). A similar relationship has also been found in the northern Pacific (Zhang et al. 2014), a stock productivity decrease lagging by four years El Niño events in this region.  Strong El Niño events shift the distribution of small and medium pelagic fishes (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, and jack mackerel) closer to the coast and, in some cases, move into deeper waters (Alheit and Niquen, 2004). They also generally lead to a reduction of anchovy biomass but actual impacts on post-event recovery differ considerably between events (Alheit and Niquen, 2004). \\

%Discussion on decadal signals: 
%Lehodey et al. (2003): -> In terms of total fluctuations in stock size and recruitment rates, skipjack and yellowfin tuna are positively influenced by the El Niño events and by the warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. 
%Suarez-Sanchez et al. (2004): -> Low-frequency yellow-fin tuna variability in the northeastern Pacific over the 1967-1993 period in apparent relation with IPO (but not discussed in the text which only mention the influence of strong EN)
%Pedraza and Diaz-Ochoa, 2006:
%Lima and Naya (2011): -> In addition to ENSO, one‐year lagged negative PDO effects on annual tuna fluctuations in the western tropical Pacific. The negative effects of PDO on skipjack tuna could be associated with the observation that during the warm phases of PDO (i.e. positive PDO values) there is a reduction in the equatorial upwelling and a rise of the sea surface temperatures at the equatorial Pacific Ocean (McPhaden and Zhang 2002). Therefore, this reduction in the ocean productivity could be influencing negatively the recruitment of skipjack tuna that are perceived the next year when the individuals recruit to the fishery. It seems that changes in sea surface temperature and ecosystem processes within the equatorial Pacific Ocean are influenced by the decadal oscillation within the North Pacific Ocean (Linsley et al. 2000, McPhaden and Zhang 2002). In sum, we determined one‐year lagged effects of SOI and PDO that can be related with ecological effects on recruitment, whereas the direct PDO effects could be caused by the effect of oceanographic conditions on tuna catchability. 
%Di Lorenzo and Ohman (2013): Theoretical modeling suggests that the cumulative integrations of white‐noise (high‐frequency) atmospheric forcing can generate red‐noise (low‐frequency) responses in oceanographic variables (as for the PDO) and thus generate marine population responses that are characterized by different regimes and strong transitions.
%Philips et al. (2014): Results indicate that SST had a positive and spatially variable effect on albacore CPUE, with increasingly positive effects to the North, while PDO had an overall negative effect. Although albacore CPUE increased with SST both before and after a threshold year of 1986, such effect geographically shifted north after 1986. This is the first study to demonstrate the non-stationary spatial dynamics of albacore tuna, linked with a major shift of the North Pacific. 
%Nicol et al. (2014): El Niño or La Niña events during multi-year periods, possibly in correlation with the PDO, could lead to regimes of high and low productivity in the tuna population (Kirby et al. 2004; Lehodey et al. 2003; Lehodey et al. 2006). However, particularly strong shifts in the environment were not always detected in tuna recruitment time series (Briand and Kirby 2006), which implies that the relationship between tuna recruitment and climatic oscillations is not linear and might depend on several interrelated factors including the adaptation of spawners to environmental variability.
%Singh et al. (2015): Significant links were established between PDO and albacore time series trajectory from 1957 to 2008 in the South Pacific Ocean.
%Singh et al. (2017): Lehodey et al. (2003) attempted to deduce the mechanisms by which alterations in environmental variables affect the stock of important tuna species in the Pacific. Results indicated that albacore tuna recruitment was significantly affected by the negative and positive phases of PDO. PDO had highly significant correlation with R in the same year and with SSB having a lag period of 5 years. This indicates that variability in the PDO pattern influences the early life stages of the North Pacific albacore tuna. With reference to Figure 3, the relationship of PDO with R and SSB is negative. This means that the negative PDO phase is favorable and positive PDO phase is unfavorable for the larvae and juvenile stages of albacore. Similar explanations have been derived for the South Pacific albacore stock by Lehodey et al. (2003) and Singh et al. (2015).
%Wu et al. 2020: The standardized CPUE in the western Pacific Ocean was significantly correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with a 1–5 year lag. 
%Lehodey et al. (2020): given that all tuna species spawn in tropical warm waters under the influence of ENSO, it can be assumed that their spawning habitats and the subsequent fish recruitment are all impacted by ENSO variability, as has been demonstrated for skipjack tuna (cf section above). The result can be a delayed fluctuation in abundance of juvenile and adult tuna moving to the NWP. This also seems to be the case for the Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) that spawn in the subtropical NWP, where the intensity of the flow and position of the bifurcation  of the North Equatorial Current change with ENSO and therefore impact larval transport and the recruitment of juveniles in the NWP (Hsiung et al., 2018).\\

%Several ecosystem models have been developed to better characterize and understand ecosystems response to climate variability and change. Models gathered in the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP) have been used to analyse changes in fish biomass induced by climate change projected by climate simulations gathered in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This project pointed to a global decline of marine biomass, mainly driven by an increase of the mean temperature and by a decrease in the primary production  (Lotze et al., 2019). This biomass change is however spatially inhomogeneous, with a decrease at middle to low latitudes, and an increase at higher latitudes. The biomass response is also more pronounced for higher trophic levels.\\
%
%While these models are now routinely used to project future biomass changes, few studies did attempt to understand how these ecosystem models respond to past climate variability. This is however a must because (1) an accurate representation of past fish biomass variations would allow a more confident assessment of future projections and (2) a better understanding of the processes response for past variability would provide some guidance to understand future changes. A tuna spatial population model (SEAPODYM, Lehodey 2004) has for instance been shown to successfully reproduce the responses of the population dynamics to changes in their physical and biological habitat (Lehodey et al. 2003). Input dataset describing the oceanic environment includes temperature, currents and oxygen concentration averaged over three integrated layers: 0–200 m (epipelagic), 200–500 m (mesopelagic) and 500–1000 m (bathypelagic); and also primary production integrated over all the vertical layers.  This model indicates that the eastward extension of the species and fisheries distributions during El Nino phases are driven by changes in temperature, prey, and dissolved oxygen concentration (Lehodey et al. 2020), and conversely during La Nina conditions (westward contraction) . This model also suggests that ENSO not only drives large-scale displacement of tuna population but can also impact their recruitment and abundance statistics (Lehodey, 2001, Lehodey et al., 2003). For instance, SEAPODYM results also suggest an increasing skipjack and yellowfin tuna recruitment in the central and the western Pacific during El Niño events (Lehodey et al., 2003, 2006; Senina et al., 2008, Langley et al. 2009) that might be a result of four mechanisms: (1) the eastward extension of the warmpool, favouring spawning of these two species, (2) enhanced food for tuna larvae due to higher primary production in the west, (3) lower predation of tuna larvae and (4) larvae retention in these favourable areas as a result of ocean currents.  Similar positive effects of El Ninos on early life stages were detected with SEAPODYM in bigeye and yellowfin tuna species, mainly in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Favorable conditions for larvae survival increase during El Nino events in the eastern Pacific Ocean and decrease in the central region. These species with longer life spans are also more susceptible to present decadal regimes of high and low productivity due to the accumulation of successive low or high peaks of recruitment driven by the decadal modulation of ENSO. A dominance of either El Nino or La Nina events is observed over multiyear periods, possibly in correlation with the Pacific‐scale Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).\\

%The modeling studies described in the above, however, have some drawbacks. First, all the models used simulate the marine ecosystem in 2D, although the impacts of El Nino events on the physical and biogeochemical ocean are 3D (shoaling/weakening of the thermocline and the relation with oxygen for instance, (Leung et al., 2019)). Add more limitations?

%The aim of the present simulation is to analyse the impacts of ENSO on the fish biomass variability simulated by the Apecosm model when it is forced by a hindcast physical biogeochemical simulation that covers the 1958-2018 period. The paper is organized as follows. The physical-biogeochemical and ecosystem models used in this study are presented in section 2. The sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll simulated by the coupled physical biogeochemical model will be confronted to observation-based datasets, in order to ensure that it properly simulates the ocean response to ENSO variability (section 3). Then, the response of epipelagic fish biomass to ENSO variability will be investigated (section 4). Discussions and perspectives are provided in section 5.
