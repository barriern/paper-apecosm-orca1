\begin{abstract}

\nino{}/Southern Oscillation, which is the Earth’s most energetic year-to-year climate event, has a significant impact on the physical and biogeochemical properties
of the tropical Pacific Ocean. In turn, it strongly affects the high trophic level organisms, especially the epipelagic fishes. 
Understanding the impact of \nino{} events on marine ecosystems and the associated mechanisms is an issue at stake, especially so for the countries that border the tropical Pacific and exploit its marine resources.

This question is addressed by using the mechanistic, DEB-based ecosystem model APECOSM, which is forced by a coupled physical/biogeochemical hindcast simulation over the 1958-2018 period. First, the simulated response to ENSO variability is compared with observations. Then, the contributions of the key processes to changes in epipelagic fish biomass in response to extreme \nino{} events are investigated. Our results suggest that advection and diffusion play a major role, especially so for larger organisms, whose biological response is very small. Smaller organisms show a strong biological response through predation and growth, with these two components compensating each other.
