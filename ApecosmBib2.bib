  abstract = {Bigeye tuna are targeted by longliners and caught incidentally by purse seiners in the tropical Pacific. The spawning biomass has been reduced significantly from unexploited levels, necessitating management action in both the western and central Pacific and eastern Pacific. Stock assessments of bigeye tuna rely primarily on data from the fisheries; however, the vulnerability of the stock to these gears, and its spatiotemporal variability, remains poorly understood, requiring simplifying assumptions to be made in the stock assessments. We analyzed the vertical behavior of 65 bigeye tuna (estimated size range 48\textendash 130 cm fork length) tracked with archival tags in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Coral Sea, and found that fish depth shows a clear gradient with longitude, becoming progressively shallower from west to east. Additive mixed models were used to explore potential relationships of the depth behavior during both day and night to several life history and environmental variables. Swimming depths were most clearly related to the thermocline depth, the intensity of temperature stratification of the water column and fish size. The model predictions suggest strong relationships between fish depth and fisheries catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) both spatially and temporally. In particular, we propose that El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation-driven changes in oceanography have a major influence on fish depth and longline CPUE, which could have substantial implications for stock assessments where longline CPUE is used as an index of abundance.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} To a certain degree, Eastern Boundary Current (EBC) ecosystems are similar: Cold bottom water from moderate depths, rich in nutrients, is transported to the euphotic zone by a combination of trade winds, Coriolis force and Ekman transport. The resultant high primary production fuels a rich secondary production in the upper pelagic and nearshore zones, but where O\textsubscript{2} exchange is restricted, it creates oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) at shelf and upper slope (Humboldt and Benguela Current) or slope depths (California Current). These hypoxic zones host a specifically adapted, small macro- and meiofauna together with giant sulphur bacteria that use nitrate to oxydise H\textsubscript{2}S. In all EBC, small polychaetes, large nematodes and other opportunistic benthic species have adapted to the hypoxic conditions and co-exist with sulphur bacteria, which seem to be particularly dominant off Peru and Chile. However, a massive reduction of macrobenthos occurs in the core of the OMZ. In the Humboldt Current area the OMZ ranges between \&lt;100 and about 600 m, with decreasing thickness in a poleward direction. The OMZ merges into better oxygenated zones towards the deep sea, where large cold-water mega- and macrofauna occupy a dominant role as in the nearshore strip. The Benguela Current OMZ has a similar upper limit but remains shallower. It also hosts giant sulphur bacteria but little is known about the benthic fauna. However, sulphur eruptions and intense hypoxia might preclude the coexistence of significant mega- und macrobenthos. Conversely, off North America the upper limit of the OMZ is considerably deeper (e.g., 500\textendash 600 m off California and Oregon), and the lower boundary may exceed 1000m. {$<$}P style="line-height: 20px;"{$>$} The properties described are valid for very cold and cold (La Ni\&\#241;a and "normal") ENSO conditions with effective upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water. During warm (El Ni\&\#241;o) episodes, warm water masses of low oxygen concentration from oceanic and equatorial regions enter the upwelling zones, bringing a variety of (sub)tropical immigrants. The autochthonous benthic fauna emigrates to deeper water or poleward, or suffers mortality. However, some local macrofaunal species experience important population proliferations, presumably due to improved oxygenation (in the southern hemisphere), higher temperature tolerance, reduced competition or the capability to use different food. Both these negative and positive effects of El Ni\&\#241;o influence local artisanal fisheries and the livelihood of coastal populations. In the Humboldt Current system the hypoxic seafloor at outer shelf depths receives important flushing from the equatorial zone, causing havoc on the sulphur bacteria mats and immediate recolonisation of the sediments by mega- and macrofauna. Conversely, off California, the intruding equatorial water masses appear to have lower oxygen than ambient waters, and may cause oxygen deficiency at upper slope depths. Effects of this change have not been studied in detail, although shrimp and other taxa appear to alter their distribution on the continental margin. Other properties and reactions of the two Pacific EBC benthic ecosystems to El Ni\&\#241;o seem to differ, too, as does the overall impact of major episodes (e.g., 1982/1983(1984) vs. 1997/1998). The relation of the "Benguela Ni\&\#241;o" to ENSO seems unclear although many Pacific-Atlantic ocean and atmosphere teleconnections have been described. Warm, low-oxygen equatorial water seems to be transported into the upwelling area by similar mechanisms as in the Pacific, but most major impacts on the eukaryotic biota obviously come from other, independent perturbations such as an extreme eutrophication of the sediments ensuing in sulphidic eruptions and toxic algal blooms. {$<$}P style="line-height: 20px;"{$>$} Similarities and differences of the Humboldt and California Current benthic ecosystems are discussed with particular reference to ENSO impacts since 1972/73. Where there are data available, the authors include the Benguela Current ecosystem as another important, non-Pacific EBC, which also suffers from the effects of hypoxia.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Diurnal vertical migration (DVM) of marine organisms is an ubiquitous phenomenon in the ocean that generates an active vertical transport of organic matter. However, the magnitude and consequences of this flux are largely unknown and are currently overlooked in ocean biogeochemical models. Here we present a global model of pelagic ecosystems based on the ocean biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES that is fully coupled to the upper trophic levels model Apex Predators ECOSystem Model, which includes an explicit description of migrating organisms. Evaluation of the model behavior proved to be challenging due to the scarcity of suitable observations. Nevertheless, the model appears to be able to simulate approximately both the migration depth and the relative biomass of migrating organisms. About one third of the epipelagic biomass is predicted to perform DVM. The flux of carbon driven by DVM is estimated to be 1.05 {$\pm$} 0.15 PgC/year, about 18\% of the passive flux of carbon due to sinking particles at 150 m. Comparison with local studies suggests that the model captures the correct magnitude of this flux. Oxygen is decreased in the mesopelagic domain by about 5 mmol m-3 relative to simulations of an ocean without DVM. Our study concludes that DVM drives a significant and very efficient flux of carbon to the mesopelagic domain, similar in magnitude to the transport of DOC. Relative to a model run without DVM, the consequences of this flux seem to be quite modest on oxygen, due to compensating effects between DVM and passive fluxes.},

The objective was to identify countries that are particularly vulnerable to disasters but also those that are less resilient. Fisheries and fishing-dependent people are often located in places that are at particularly high risk of extreme events such as flooding, cyclones, and tsunamis, while inland fisheries can be significantly affected by droughts and floods. In addition to the tragic loss of life, disasters can have direct impacts on livelihoods such as destruction of gear, infrastructure and productive assets, such as boats, landing sites, and post-harvesting facilities. Indirect impacts can also be important through disruption to markets and through reducing harvesting capacity and access to markets, food supply and employment, thereby affecting both local livelihoods and the overall economy. The circular concludes that the fishery sectors of African and Southeast Asian countries are most vulnerable to disasters, according to both frequency and mortality exposure indicators, fishery-dependence, and capacity to adapt.

This spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model Eco3M-S/SYMPHONIE (LTL \textendash{} low trophic level model) to OSMOSE (HTL \textendash{} high trophic level model). It includes 15 compartments of living organisms, five from the LTL model (i.e. nanophytoplankton, microphytoplankton, nanozooplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and ten from the HTL model (northern krill, southern shortfin squid, European pilchard, European anchovy, European sprat, Atlantic horse mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, European hake and Atlantic bluefin tuna). With the exception of northern krill and European sprat, all HTL species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure. The modeled species represent more than 70\% of annual catches in this area. This paper presents the parameterization, calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass, landings, diet and trophic level data for HTL groups. For most species, the diets in output of OSMOSE-GoL are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species. However, some differences were observed. Various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data. Benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the HTL predators were not modeled in OSMOSE-GoL. Field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations, while our data concern the period 2001\textendash 2004 and the entire modeled domain. Inter- and intra-annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences. The model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the HTL compartments. These values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous Ecopath model for the same area and period. Even though some improvements are still possible, this model may already be of use to explore fishery or Marine Protected Areas scenarios for socio-ecosystem management issues.},

  abstract = {In the mid 1990s, the North Atlantic subpolar gyre has shown a dramatic warming event that has been thoroughly investigated from observations and numerical simulations. Some studies suggest that it was due to an interannual, wind-driven weakening and shrinking of the gyre that facilitated the penetration of warm Atlantic Water, the weakening of the gyre being attributed to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and in the East Atlantic Pattern, which are the two dominant modes of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic. However, other studies suggest that the warming event was due to a decadal, buoyancy-driven strengthening of the meridional overturning circulation and subsequent intensification of the poleward heat transport, in response to the positive NAO conditions of 1988\textendash 1995. To reconcile this discrepancy, the heat budget in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is reconstructed from four ocean hindcast simulations sharing the same modelling platform but using different settings. The novelty of this work is the decomposition of the subpolar gyre into a western and an eastern subregion, which is motivated by water mass distribution around Reykjanes Ridge and by the fact that deep convection only occurs in the western subpolar gyre. In the western subpolar gyre, the 1995 warming event is the decadal, baroclinic ocean response to positive NAO conditions from 1988 to 1995. The latter induced increased surface heat loss in the Labrador Sea that intensified deep convection hence strengthened the meridional overturning circulation and the associated poleward heat transport. In the eastern subregion, a concomittant warming is induced by an interannual, barotropic adjustment of the gyre circulation to an abrupt switch from positive NAO conditions in winter 1995 to negative NAO conditions in winter 1996. Indeed, the gyre response to negative NAO conditions is a cyclonic intergyre-gyre that increases northward volume and heat transports at the southeastern limit of the subpolar gyre. Therefore, the discrepancies found in the literature about the 1995 warming event of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre are reconciled in the present work, which suggests that the atmospheric drivers, the mechanisms at stake and the associated timescales are different to the east and to the west of Reykjanes Ridge.},

Sea-level anomalies can be viewed as proxies for the subtropical gyre intensity because of the intrinsic baroclinic structure of the circulation. Our results show that the strongest correlation between SSH and weather regimes is found with the so-called Atlantic-Ridge (AR) while no significant values are obtained for the other regimes, including those related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), known as the primary actor of the Atlantic dynamics. Wintertime AR events are characterized by anticyclonic wind anomalies off Europe leading to a northward shift of the climatological wind-stress curl. The latter affects subtropical SSH annual variability by altered Sverdrup balance and ocean Rossby wave dynamics propagating westward from the African coast towards the Caribbean. The use of a simple linear planetary geostrophic model allows to quantify those effects and confirms the primary importance of the winter season to explain the largest part of SSH interannual variability in the Atlantic subtropical gyre. Our results open new perspectives in the comprehension of North-Atlantic Ocean variability emphasizing the role of AR as a driver of interannual variability at least of comparable importance to NAO.},

  abstract = {A new framework is proposed for investigating the atmospheric forcing of North Atlantic Ocean circulation. Instead of using classical modes of variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or the east Atlantic pattern, the weather regimes paradigm was used. Using this framework helped avoid problems associated with the assumptions of orthogonality and symmetry that are particular to modal analysis and known to be unsuitable for the NAO. Using ocean-only historical and sensitivity experiments, the impacts of the four winter weather regimes on horizontal and overturning circulations were investigated. The results suggest that the Atlantic Ridge (AR), negative NAO (NAO-), and positive NAO (NAO+) regimes induce a fast (monthly-to-interannual time scales) adjustment of the gyres via topographic Sverdrup dynamics and of the meridional overturning circulation via anomalous Ekman transport. The wind anomalies associated with the Scandinavian blocking regime (SBL) are ineffective in driving a fast wind-driven oceanic adjustment. The response of both gyre and overturning circulations to persistent regime conditions was also estimated. AR causes a strong, wind-driven reduction in the strengths of the subtropical and subpolar gyres, while NAO+ causes a strengthening of the subtropical gyre via wind stress curl anomalies and of the subpolar gyre via heat flux anomalies. NAO- induces a southward shift of the gyres through the southward displacement of the wind stress curl. The SBL is found to impact the subpolar gyre only via anomalous heat fluxes. The overturning circulation is shown to spin up following persistent SBL and NAO+ and to spin down following persistent AR and NAO- conditions. These responses are driven by changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea.},

  abstract = {The Northern Mediterranean Current is the return branch of the cyclonic circulation of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope of the Gulf of Lion. But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on the eastern part of the gulf are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the Gulf of Lion coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and are related to the development of upwellings along the Gulf of Lion coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the Gulf of Lion shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the intrusions permits to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Lion.},

In this volatile ecosystem, fish have been led to develop adaptive strategies in space and time. In this paper, we attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying such strategies, focusing on the El Ni\~no 1997\textendash 98 in Peru from which an extensive set of hydrographic, capture and acoustic survey data are available. An integrated analysis of the data is crucial, as each has substantial shortcomings individually; for example, both catch data and acoustic surveys may easily lead to wrong conclusions. Existing hypotheses on anchovy and sardine alternations lead us to a `habitat-based' synthetic hypothesis. Using our data, an integrated approach evaluated how fish responded to habitat variation, and determined the consequences in terms of fish-population variability. Various factors occurring at a range of different spatio-temporal scales were considered: interdecadal regime (warm `El Viejo'/cool `La Vieja' decadal scale); strength and the duration of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation event (interannual scale); population condition before the event (interannual scale); fishing pressure and other predation (annual scale); changes in reproductive behaviour (intra-annual scale); presence of local upwelling (local scale). During El Ni\~no 1997\textendash 98, anchovy was able to exploit a small-scale temporal and spatial `loophole' inside the general unfavourable conditions. Moreover, sardine did not do better than anchovy during this El Ni\~no and was not able to take advantage of the `loophole' opened by this short-term event. Our results question the traditional view that El Ni\~no is bad for anchovy and good for sardine.},

  abstract = {We measured the horizontal and vertical movements of five adult yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, estimated body mass 64 to 93\,kg) near the main Hawaiian Islands, while simultaneously gathering data on oceanographic conditions and currents. Fish movements were recorded by means of ultrasonic depth-sensitive transmitters. Depth\textendash temperature and depth\textendash oxygen profiles were measured with vertical conductivity\textendash temperature\textendash depth (CTD) casts, and the current-velocity field was surveyed using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). Large adult yellowfin tuna spent {$\simeq$}60 to 80\% of their time in or immediately below the relatively uniform-temperature surface-layer (i.e. above 100\,m), a behavior pattern similar to that previously reported for juvenile yellowfin tuna, blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) tracked in the same area. In all three species, maximum swimming depths appear to be limited by water temperatures 8\,C\textdegree{} colder than the surface-layer water temperature. Therefore, neither large body mass, nor the ability to maintain elevated swimming-muscle temperatures due to the presence of vascular counter-current heat exchangers in tunas, appears to permit greater vertical mobility or the ability to remain for extended periods below the thermocline. In those areas where the decrease in oxygen with depth is not limiting, the vertical movements of yellowfin tuna, blue marlin and striped marlin all appear to be restricted by the effects of water temperature on cardiac muscle function. Like juvenile yellowfin tuna, but unlike blue marlin and striped marlin, adult yellowfin tuna remained within 18.5\,km of the coast and became associated with floating objects, including anchored fish-aggregating devices (FADs) and the tracking vessel. Like juvenile yellowfin tuna, large adult yellowfin repeatedly re-visit the same FAD, and appear able to navigate precisely between FADs that are up to 18\,km apart. The median speed over ground ranged from 72 to 154\,cm\,s-1. Neither speed nor direction was strongly influenced by currents.},

The analysis was carried out using a simulation approach based on the ecosystem model OSMOSE in the southern Benguela. We show that the 13 ecosystem indicators have reference points at MMSY that are highly variable across fishing strategies. The state of the ecosystem at MMSY is so variable across fishing strategies that it is not possible to set reference points without considering the fishing strategy. However, strategy-specific reference points were found to constitute robust proxies for MMSY in more than 90\% of the simulated fishing strategies. For instance, under the current fishing strategy in the southern Benguela, robust reference points at MMSY could be identified for the following indicators: mean length of fish, mean lifespan, biomass over catch ratio, trophic level of the surveys, mean trophic index, proportion of predatory fish, intrinsic vulnerability index, and mean maximum length.},

In this Review, we synthesize advances in observed and projected changes of multiple aspects of ENSO, including the processes behind such changes. As in previous syntheses, there is an inter-model consensus of an increase in future ENSO rainfall variability. Now, however, it is apparent that models that best capture key ENSO dynamics also tend to project an increase in future ENSO sea surface temperature variability and, thereby, ENSO magnitude under greenhouse warming, as well as an eastward shift and intensification of ENSO-related atmospheric teleconnections \textemdash{} the Pacific\textendash North American and Pacific\textendash South American patterns. Such projected changes are consistent with palaeoclimate evidence of stronger ENSO variability since the 1950s compared with past centuries. The increase in ENSO variability, though underpinned by increased equatorial Pacific upper-ocean stratification, is strongly influenced by internal variability, raising issues about its quantifiability and detectability. Yet, ongoing coordinated community efforts and computational advances are enabling long-simulation, large-ensemble experiments and high-resolution modelling, offering encouraging prospects for alleviating model biases, incorporating fundamental dynamical processes and reducing uncertainties in projections.},

This first paper (in a series of three) describes the transition in terms of the emergent flow structure and the associated time-averaged eddy fluxes. In addition to the mesoscale eddies that arise from a primary instability of the alongshore, wind-driven currents, significant energy is transferred into submesoscale fronts and vortices in the upper ocean. The submesoscale arises through surface frontogenesis growing off upwelled cold filaments that are pulled offshore and strained in between the mesoscale eddy centers. In turn, some submesoscale fronts become unstable and develop submesoscale meanders and fragment into roll-up vortices. Associated with this phenomenon are a large vertical vorticity and Rossby number, a large vertical velocity, relatively flat horizontal spectra (contrary to the prevailing view of mesoscale dynamics), a large vertical buoyancy flux acting to restratify the upper ocean, a submesoscale energy conversion from potential to kinetic, a significant spatial and temporal intermittency in the upper ocean, and material exchanges between the surface boundary layer and pycnocline. Comparison with available observations indicates that submesoscale fronts and instabilities occur widely in the upper ocean, with characteristics similar to the simulations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

These models allow for policy-relevant calculations such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compatible with a specified climate stabilization target. In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using `performance metrics'. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections. \{9.1.2, 9.8.1, Table 9.1, Figure 9.44\}{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The ability of climate models to simulate surface temperature has improved in many, though not all, important aspects relative to the generation of models assessed in the AR4.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

  abstract = {A coupled physical\textendash biogeochemical model has been developed in order to study physical\textendash biological interactions in the tropical Pacific Ocean on seasonal-to-interannual timescales. The model incorporates both iron- and nitrogen-limited phytoplankton growth, and succession of phytoplankton size classes in accordance with the ``ecumenical'' iron hypothesis. The model shows a strong El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation component to phytoplankton variability in the central equatorial Pacific over the period 1980\textendash 1998. It is possible that this mode is more dominant in the model than in nature, although the correlation of modelled and observed chlorophyll in this region is strong. The model results show that interannual variability dominates over the mean seasonal cycle for both physical and biogeochemical fields, with the exception of undercurrent transport west of the dateline. Physical and biogeochemical fields show consistent seasonal phasing among the four El Ni\~no events simulated, although there is variability in the magnitudes and exact timing. Nutrient concentration anomalies at constant temperature in the thermocline of the central equatorial Pacific appear to be largely advected from the west, and the strong seasonal cycle of the equatorial undercurrent in the west introduces a significant annual component to the variability of nutrient concentrations at longitudes where the mean seasonal cycle of the local physical forcing is negligible. The biogeochemical model maintains realistic nutrient pools over the time scales required for interannual simulation, and responds in a realistic fashion to changing upper ocean hydrography and circulation. The model is quite sensitive to the temporal resolution of the wind forcing, which introduces additional uncertainty into the validation and prediction of biogeochemical fields.},

  abstract = {The Peru-Chile current System (PCS) is a region of persistent biases in global climate models. It has strong coastal upwelling, alongshore boundary currents, and mesoscale eddies. These oceanic phenomena provide essential heat transport to maintain a cool oceanic surface underneath the prevalent atmospheric stratus cloud deck, through a combination of mean circulation and eddy flux. We demonstrate these behaviors in a regional, quasi-equilibrium oceanic model that adequately resolves the mesoscale eddies with climatological forcing. The key result is that the atmospheric heating is large ({$>$}50~W m-2) over a substantial strip {$>$}500~km wide off the coast of Peru, and the balancing lateral oceanic flux is much larger than provided by the offshore Ekman flux alone. The atmospheric heating is weaker and the coastally influenced strip is narrower off Chile, but again the Ekman flux is not sufficient for heat balance. The eddy contribution to the oceanic flux is substantial. Analysis of eddy properties shows strong surface temperature fronts and associated large vorticity, especially off Peru. Cyclonic eddies moderately dominate the surface layer, and anticyclonic eddies, originating from the nearshore poleward Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC), dominate the subsurface, especially off Chile. The sensitivity of the PCS heat balance to equatorial intra-seasonal oscillations is found to be small. We demonstrate that forcing the regional model with a representative, coarse-resolution global reanalysis wind product has dramatic and deleterious consequences for the oceanic circulation and climate heat balance, the eddy heat flux in particular.},

  abstract = {Understanding larval connectivity patterns is critical for marine spatial planning, particularly for designing marine protected areas and managing fisheries. Patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity can be inferred from numerical transport models at large spatial and temporal scales. We assess model-based connectivity patterns between seamounts of the Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) and the coastal ecosystems of Mauritius, La R\'eunion, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa, with emphasis on three shallow seamounts (La P\'erouse [LP], MAD-Ridge [MR] and Walters Shoal [WS]). Using drifter trajectory and a Lagrangian model of ichthyoplankton dispersal, we show that larvae can undertake very long dispersion, with larval distances increasing with pelagic larval duration (PLD). There are three groups of greater connectivity: the region between the eastern coast of Madagascar, Mauritius and La R\'eunion islands; the seamounts of the South West Indian Ridge; and the pair formed by WS and a nearby un-named seamount. Connectivity between these three groups is evident only for the longest PLD examined (360~d). Connectivity from seamounts to coastal ecosystems is weak, with a maximum of 2\% of larvae originating from seamounts reaching coastal ecosystems. Local retention at the three focal seamounts (LP, MR and WS) peaks at about 11\% for the shortest PLD considered (15~d) at the most retentive seamount (WS) and decreases sharply with increasing PLD. Information on PLD and age of larvae collected at MR and LP are used to assess their putative origin. These larvae are likely self-recruits but it is also plausible that they immigrate from nearby coastal sites, i.e. the southern coast of Madagascar for MR and the islands of La R\'eunion and Mauritius for LP.},

The use of a fully dynamic two-ways coupling between the models of Low and High Trophic Levels organisms provided some insights in the functioning of the food web in the Gulf of Lions. On the whole microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton were found to be preyed upon by High Trophic Levels planktivorous groups at rates lower than 20\% and 30\% of their respective natural mortality rates, but these relatively low rates involved some important alterations in the infra-seasonal and annual cycles of both High and Low Trophic Levels groups. They induced significant changes in biomass, fisheries landings and food web interactions by cascading effects. Spatial differential impacts of High Trophic Levels predation on plankton are less clear except in areas in which primary productivity is high. Higher predation rates on plankton groups were encountered within the area of the Rhone river's influence and in areas associated to the presence of mesoscale eddies in the Northwestern part of the Gulf of Lions, especially. Generally, the pressure of the High Trophic Levels predation was the highest in areas of highest biomass whatever the plankton group considered. The two-ways coupling between Low and High Trophic Levels models revealed both bottom-up and top-down controls in the ecosystem with effects on planktivorous species similar to those observed in the field. The use of the end-to-end model enabled to propose a set of potential mechanisms that may explain the observed decrease in small pelagic catches by the French Mediterranean artisanal fisheries over the last decade.},

Our algorithm corresponds to a variant of the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) genetic algorithm, with a specific ``optimal individual'' operator. The method is presented in detail and applied to the individual-based model OSMOSE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated and estimated parameters are compared with an independent manual calibration. The results show that automated and convergent methods for inverse parameter estimation are a significant improvement to existing ad hoc methods for the calibration of IBMs.},

Most of the earlier studies have primarily focused on the temporal dimension of the relationship in the framework of the match\textendash mismatch hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that predator's recruitment will be high if the peak of the prey availability temporally matches the most energy-demanding period of the predators breeding phenology. However, the match\textendash mismatch hypothesis ignores the level of food abundance while this can compensate small mismatches. Using a novel time-series model explicitly quantifying both the timing and the abundance component for trophic relationships, we here show that timing and abundance of food affect recruitment differently in a marine (cod/zooplankton), a marine\textendash terrestrial (puffin/herring) and a terrestrial (sheep/vegetation) ecosystem. The quantification of the combined effect of abundance and timing of prey on predator dynamics enables us to come closer to the mechanisms by which environment variability may affect ecological systems.},

Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production2,3. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals4 are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

  abstract = {The Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) of the Tropical South Eastern Pacific (TSEP) is one of the most intensely deoxygenated water masses of the global ocean. It is strongly affected at interannual time scales by El Ni\~no (EN) and La Ni\~na (LN) due to its proximity to the equatorial Pacific. In this work, the physical and biogeochemical processes associated with the subsurface oxygen variability during EN and LN in the period 1958 \textendash{} 2008 were studied using a regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model and in situ observations. The passage of intense remotely forced coastal trapped waves caused a strong deepening (shoaling) of the OMZ upper limit during EN (LN). A close correlation between the OMZ upper limit and thermocline depths was found close to the coast, highlighting the role of physical processes. The subsurface waters over the shelf and slope off central Peru had different origins depending on ENSO conditions. Offshore of the upwelling region (near 88\textdegree W), negative and positive oxygen subsurface anomalies were caused by Equatorial zonal circulation changes during LN and EN, respectively. The altered properties were then transported to the shelf and slope (above 200 m) by the Peru-Chile undercurrent. The source of nearshore oxygenated waters was located at 3\textdegree S \textendash{} 4\textdegree S during neutral periods, further north (1\textdegree S \textendash{} 1\textdegree N) during EN and further south (4\textdegree S \textendash{} 5\textdegree S) during LN. The offshore deeper ({$<$} 200 \textendash{} 300 m) OMZ was ventilated by waters originating from \textasciitilde{} 8\textdegree S during EN and LN. Enhanced mesoscale variability during EN also impacted OMZ ventilation through horizontal and vertical eddy fluxes. The vertical eddy flux decreased due to the reduced vertical gradient of oxygen in the surface layer, whereas horizontal eddy fluxes injected more oxygen into the OMZ through its meridional boundaries. In subsurface layers, remineralization of organic matter, the main biogeochemical sink of oxygen, was higher during EN than during LN due to oxygenation of the surface layer and in spite of a reduced primary production. Sensitivity experiments highlighted the larger impact of equatorial remote forcing with respect to local wind forcing during EN and LN.},

We derive an advection\textendash diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) which approximates this individual-based model (IBM). The approximation process enables us to obtain a mechanistic representation of the advection and diffusion coefficients which improves the heuristic approaches of former studies. Advection and diffusion are linked and exhibit antagonistic behaviors: strong advection goes with weak diffusion leading to a directed movement of fish. On the contrary weak advection goes with strong diffusion corresponding to a searching behavior. Simulations are conducted for both models which are compared by computing spatial statistics. It is shown that the PDE model is a good approximation to the IBM.},

Large-scale spatial patterns of some zooplankton groups show broad coincidence with surface water masses, circulation, and upwelling regions, in agreement with an ecological and dynamic partitioning of the pelagic ecosystem. The papers reviewed and a new compilation of zooplankton volume data at large-scale show that abundance patterns of zooplankton biomass have their highest values in the upwelling regions, including the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the Costa Rica Dome, the equatorial cold tongue, and the coast of Peru. Some of the first studies of zooplankton vertical distribution were done in this region, and a general review of the topic is presented. The possible physiological implications of vertical migration in zooplankton and the main hypotheses are described, with remarks on the importance of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) as a barrier to both the vertical distribution and migration of zooplankton in the region. Recent results, using multiple-net gear, show that vertical distribution is more complex than previously thought. There are some well-adapted species that do live and migrate within the OMZ. Temporal patterns are reviewed and summarized with historical data. Seasonal variations in zooplankton biomass follow productivity cycles in upwelling areas. No zooplankton time series exist to resolve ENSO effects in oceanic regions, but some El Ni\~no events have had effects in the Peru Current ecosystem. Multidecadal periods of up to 50 years show a shift from a warm sardine regime with a low zooplankton biomass to a cool anchovy regime in the eastern Pacific with higher zooplankton biomasses. However, zooplankton volume off Peru has remained at low values since the 1972 El Ni\~no, a trend opposite to that of anchoveta biomass since 1984. Studies of trophic relations emphasize the difference in the productivity cycle in the eastern tropical Pacific compared to temperate or polar ecosystems, with no particular peaks in the stocks of either zooplankton or phytoplankton. Productivity is more dependent on local events like coastal upwelling or water circulation, especially in the equatorial countercurrent and around the equatorial cool-tongue. Micrograzers are very important in the tropics as are predatory mesozooplankton. Up to 70\% of the daily primary productivity is consumed by microzooplankton, which thus regulates the phytoplankton stocks. Micrograzers are an important link between primary producers, including bacteria, and mesozooplankton, constituting up to 80\% of mesozooplankton food. Oceanography affects zooplankton trophic relationships through spatial\textendash temporal effects on primary productivity and on the distributions of metabolic factors, food organisms, and predators.

Our results indicate that, under unfavorable conditions, the degree to which species biomass was reduced varied among species, and that negative synergistic and negative dampened effects were dominant under historical and doubled fishing mortality rates, respectively. Under favorable conditions, species biomasses did not increase as much as expected due to the existence of complex predator-prey interactions among fish species, and positive synergistic and positive dampened effects were prevailing under historical and halved fishing mortality rates, respectively.

However, such responses have not been adequately investigated, especially in terms of the relevant physical processes. This paper addresses the mechanistic differences in the biological response of the equatorial Pacific Ocean during the strongest CP- and EP-El Ni\~no to date (i.e., 1997\textendash 98 EP-El Ni\~no and 2009\textendash 10 CP-El Ni\~no) using satellite data and water mass pathway analysis based on an ocean reanalysis product. The 1997\textendash 98 EP-El Ni\~no was associated with a larger reduction of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) and the 2009\textendash 10 CP-El Ni\~no was associated with a larger reduction of chl-a in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP). These biological responses were dependent on the strength and extent of westerly wind anomalies and their impact on horizontal and vertical processes. Horizontal advection was the primary contributor to differences in chl-a between the two El Ni\~no events in the CEP, whereas vertical advection and mixing were the dominant processes in the EEP.},

  abstract = {The northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is a region strongly influenced by river discharges of freshwater and nutrients, which promote a highly productive coastal ecosystem that host commercially valuable marine species. A variety of climate and weather processes could potentially influence the river discharges into the northern GoM. However, their impacts on the coastal ecosystem remain poorly described. By using a regional ocean-biogeochemical model, complemented with satellite and in situ observations, here we show that El Ni\~no - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a main driver of the interannual variability in salinity and plankton biomass during winter and spring. Composite analysis of salinity and plankton biomass anomalies shows a strong asymmetry between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na impacts, with much larger amplitude and broader areas affected during El Ni\~no conditions. Further analysis of the model simulation reveals significant coastal circulation anomalies driven by changes in salinity and winds. The coastal circulation anomalies in turn largely determine the spatial extent and distribution of the ENSO-induced plankton biomass variability. These findings highlight that ENSO-induced changes in salinity, plankton biomass, and coastal circulation across the northern GoM are closely interlinked and may significantly impact the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrates.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem model OSMOSE-WFS was employed to evaluate natural mortality rates and fishing scenarios for Gulf of Mexico (GOM) red grouper (Epinephelus morio). OSMOSE-WFS represents major high trophic level (HTL) groups of species of the West Florida Shelf, is forced by the biomass of plankton and benthos groups, and has a monthly time step. The present application of the model uses a recently developed `stochastic mortality algorithm' to resolve the mortality processes of HTL groups. OSMOSE-WFS predictions suggest that the natural mortality rate of juveniles of GOM red grouper is high and essentially due to predation, while the bulk of the natural mortality of adult red grouper results from causes not represented in OSMOSE-WFS such as, presumably, red tides. These results were communicated to GOM red grouper stock assessments. Moreover, OSMOSE-WFS indicate that altering the fishing mortality of GOM red grouper may have no global impact on the biomass of the major prey of red grouper, due to the high complexity and high redundancy of the modeled system. By contrast, altering the fishing mortality of GOM red grouper may have a large impact on the biomass of its major competitors. Increasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would increase the biomass of major competitors, due to reduced competition for food. Conversely, decreasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would diminish the biomass of major competitors, due to increased predation pressure on the juveniles of the major competitors by red grouper. The fishing scenarios that we evaluated may have slightly different impacts in the real world, due to some discrepancies between the diets of red grouper and its major competitors predicted by OSMOSE-WFS and the observed ones. Modifications in OSMOSE-WFS are suggested to reduce these discrepancies.},

  abstract = {Physical and biogeochemical changes of the oceans have complex influences on fish communities. Variations of resource and temperature affect metabolic rates at the individual level, biomass fluxes at the species level, and trophic structure as well as diversity at the community level. We use a Dynamic Energy Budget-, trait-based model of the consumers' community size-spectrum to assess the effects of lower trophic level biomass and water temperature on communities at steady state. First, we look at the stressors separately in idealized simulations, varying one while the second remains constant. A multi-domain response is observed. Linked to the number of trophic levels sustained in the consumers' community, the regimes highlighted present similar properties when lower trophic level biomass is increased or temperature decreased. These trophic-length domains correspond to different efficiencies of the transfer of biomass from small to large individuals. They are characterized by different sensitivities of fish communities to environmental changes. Moreover, differences in the scaling of individuals' metabolism and prey assimilation with temperature lead to a shrinking of fish communities with warming. In a second step, we look at the impact of simultaneous variations of stressors along a mean latitudinal gradient of lower trophic level biomass and temperature. The model explains known observed features of global marine ecosystems such as the fact that larger species compose fish communities when latitude increases. The structure, diversity and metabolic properties of fish communities obtained with the model at different latitudes are interpreted in light of the different trophic-length domains characterized in the idealized experiments. From the equator to the poles, the structure of consumers' communities is predicted to be heterogeneous, with variable sensitivities to environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The regularity of the community size-spectrum, i.e., the fact that the total ecosystem biomass contained in logarithmically equal body size intervals remains constant, is a striking characteristic of marine ecosystems. Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size-spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios.},

This approach consisted in forcing a high trophic level model (OSMOSE) with an existing biogeochemical model (Eco3M-MED) representing the seasonal dynamics of the low trophic levels. The two models were linked through trophic interactions to represent the ecosystem dynamics from primary producers to top predators. In this study, we developed the multispecies, individual-based model OSMOSE in the Gulf of Gabes (OSMOSE-GoG). This model aims to capture the main processes that influence species life cycle and simulate the functioning of the ecosystem according to opportunistic predation process based on size selection and spatio-temporal co-occurrence between a predator and its prey. The spatial distribution of the eleven modelled species was derived from a Multi-Scale Species Distribution Modelling approach. We calibrated OSMOSE-GoG model with available data of biomass and fishing yield, using an optimization method based on evolutionary algorithms which is suitable for complex and stochastic models. Finally, OSMOSE-GoG was validated against independent data sets at different hierarchical levels: the individual (diet composition), population (mean size of commercial catch) and community levels (mean trophic level) following the Pattern-Oriented Modelling approach. The model outputs were overall consistent with the diet compositions and mean trophic levels derived from the ECOPATH model of the Gulf of Gabes (ECOPATH-GoG) and the observations of mean size of catches. The OSMOSE-GoG can be considered as a baseline model to investigate ecosystem responses to environmental changes and fishing management measures in the Gulf of Gabes.},

Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems.},

This approach yields a model in which geostrophic eddies are quasi-adiabatic in the ocean interior, so that the residual-mean overturning circulation aligns almost perfectly with density contours. A reentrant channel configuration of the MIT General Circulation Model, that approximates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is used to examine these issues. Virtual analogs of ocean deliberate tracer release field experiments reinforce our conclusion, producing passive tracer solutions that parallel field experiments remarkably well.},

The timing of ENSO events and of related oceanic changes at higher latitudes were examined. The frequency of ENSO was high in the 1980s. Evidence of ENSO forcing on ocean conditions in the North Pacific (Ni\~no North conditions) showed ENSO events were more frequently observed along the West Coast than in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Time series of catches for 30 region/species groups of salmon, and recruitment data for 29 groundfish and 5 non-salmonid pelagic species, were examined for evidence of a statistical relationship with any of the time scales associated with Ni\~no North conditions or the PDO. Some flatfish stocks exhibited high autocorrelation in recruitment coupled with a significant step in recruitment in 1977 suggesting a relationship between PDO forcing and recruitment success. Five of the dominant gadid stocks (EBS and GOA Pacific cod, Pacific hake and EBS and GOA walleye pollock) exhibited low autocorrelation in recruitment. Of these, Pacific hake, GOA walleye pollock and GOA Pacific cod exhibited significantly higher incidence of strong year classes in years associated with Ni\~no North conditions. These findings suggest that the PDO and ENSO may play an important role in governing year-class strength of several Northeast Pacific marine fish stocks.},

  abstract = {In the context of advection of trace species by 3D atmospheric flows, a comparative test of a hierarchy of finite volume transport schemes initially derived by B. Van Leer is presented. Those schemes are conservative by construction and Van Leer proposed a simple way of ensuring monotonicity. One of the schemes, introduced independently in the atmospheric community by M. J. Prather, is now considered as a reference in the GCM community. An important aspect of the present work is to perform test simulations with various spatial resolutions in order to compare the various schemes at a comparable numerical cost. The result is that higher-order schemes are much more accurate than lower order at a given spatial resolution but much more comparable when the lower-order schemes are run on a finer grid to make the numerical costs equivalent. Moreover, the higher moments of the tracer distribution introduced in the more sophisticated schemes become an issue when other processes such as chemistry or turbulent mixing are accounted for. Finally, it is suggested that Van Leer scheme I is well suited for transport of trace species by 3D atmospheric winds. The results are shown of applications to the transport of radon in the GCM of Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique. The GCM implementation of Van Leer scheme I is conservative, positive, and monotonic, and it does not modify a uniform tracer distribution.},

However, the results for individual years showed considerable interannual variability, both in the strength of the monsoon and in the time of onset. A relationship has been identified between the evolution of the monsoon flow and the phase of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In agreement with observed results, years with warm SST anomalies in the equatorial central and east Pacific Ocean (El Ni\~no) have a weaker monsoon circulation and a delayed onset. an opposite behaviour is noted for those years with cold Pacific SST anomalies (La Ni\~na). Diagnostics from analyses from the National Meteorological Center and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts, and from data on the outgoing long-wave radiation observed by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, have been used to verify the model results. A description of the mechanism by which the phase of ENSO remotely influences the dynamics of the Asian summer monsoon has been developed involving changes in the heating patterns over Indonesia and the west Pacific in the preceding spring.},

  abstract = {The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) conducted the second Japanese global atmospheric reanalysis, called the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis or JRA-55. It covers the period from 1958, when regular radiosonde observations began on a global basis. JRA-55 is the first comprehensive reanalysis that has covered the last half-century since the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 45-year Reanalysis (ERA-40), and is the first one to apply four-dimensional variational analysis to this period. The main objectives of JRA-55 were to address issues found in previous reanalyses and to produce a comprehensive atmospheric dataset suitable for studying multidecadal variability and climate change. This paper describes the observations, data assimilation system, and forecast model used to produce JRA-55 as well as the basic characteristics of the JRA-55 product.\hspace{1em}JRA-55 has been produced with the TL319 version of JMA's operational data assimilation system as of December 2009, which was extensively improved since the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25). It also uses several newly available and improved past observations. The resulting reanalysis products are considerably better than the JRA-25 product. Two major problems of JRA-25 were a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, which has been diminished, and a dry bias in the Amazon basin, which has been mitigated. The temporal consistency of temperature analysis has also been considerably improved compared to previous reanalysis products. Our initial quality evaluation revealed problems such as a warm bias in the upper troposphere, large upward imbalance in the global mean net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, excessive precipitation over the tropics, and unrealistic trends in analyzed tropical cyclone strength. This paper also assesses the impacts of model biases and changes in the observing system, and mentions efforts to further investigate the representation of low-frequency variability and trends in JRA-55.},

The irregular occurrence of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events has implications for public health. On a global scale, the human effect of natural disasters increases during El Ni\~no. The effect of ENSO on cholera risk in Bangladesh, and malaria epidemics in parts of South Asia and South America has been well established. The strongest evidence for an association between ENSO and disease is provided by time-series analysis with data series that include more than one event. Evidence for ENSO's effect on other mosquito-borne and rodent-borne diseases is weaker than that for malaria and cholera. Health planners are used to dealing with spatial risk concepts but have little experience with temporal risk management. ENSO and seasonal climate forecasts might offer the opportunity to target scarce resources for epidemic control and disaster preparedness.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Published online May 20, 2003 http://image.thelancet.com/extras/02art5336web.pdf{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here the similarities and differences in these life cycles are examined. Qualitatively different behavior between warm events and cold events exists in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans and in the extratropical Pacific. Even in the tropical Pacific statistically significantly different behavior is found in some variables for particular regions and phases of the life cycles. A single-mode regression analysis of the ENSO signal is done; the patterns are very similar to those of previously published ENSO EOF and regression analyses. The authors describe how the regression patterns obscure many of the interesting life cycles and life cycle differences of cold events and warm events. Most of the regression structures outside of the tropical Pacific are not statistically significant because of such differences. ENSO models should be evaluated against their ability to reproduce the observed cold event and warm event life cycles and not just single EOF or regression mode patterns.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper synthesizes published results on the carbon cycle of the equatorial Pacific which accounts for a major fraction of the net exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the oceans. Most of the CO2 evasion takes place in the upwelling-influenced region in the eastern Pacific, while atmospheric and sea-surface partial pressures of CO2 are near equilibrium in the warm pool, located to the west. Large changes in the surface area of the upwelling region, which occur as a result of the ENSO (El Ni\~no\textemdash Southern Oscillation) phenomenon, account for up to 70\% of the interannual variability in the net air\textendash sea flux of CO2. On average, the export of biological production, which is approximately the same as new primary production, is similar to that of CO2 evasion (0.8\textendash 1.0Pg Cyr-1), but there is less temporal variability due to the very slow uptake of new macronutrients in the equatorial ecosystem. As in other tropical ecosystems, both the warm pool and upwelling areas are characterized by: (i) the dominance of picophytoplankton, and (ii) the steady state, achieved by the balance between predation and growth. In addition to the basic tropical population of nano- and picoplankton, larger phytoplankton are more abundant in the nutrient-replete waters of the upwelling region with the result that biomass, mean organism size and export fluxes are greater than in the nutrient-depleted waters of the warm pool. However, the difference in export flux of carbon between the two regions is rather modest (2\textendash 4 fold per unit area) because of the limitation of primary production in the upwelling zone by iron and, possibly, other nutrients. The latter is a typical HNLC (high-nutrient\textendash low-chlorophyll) zone with very low rates of uptake of macronutrients and an essentially constant export flux of carbon due to the `biological pump'. This general pattern is temporarily disturbed by the passage of equatorial Kelvin waves and tropical instability waves (TIW) in the upwelling region through horizontal advection and possible inputs of micronutrients from the deeper layers. Finally, low-frequency variations on decadal time scales could influence the values of the CO2 evasion and the `biological pump'. Studying their impact will require long-term monitoring.},

  abstract = {We used literature reports to evaluate the hypotheses that: 1. year-class strenght in marine fishes is determined by mortality operating during the pre-juvenile stage of the life history, and 2. recruitment in marine fishes can be regulated by starvation and predation in the egg and larval stages. The available evidence is largely consistent with the first hypothesis, although mortality operating during the juvenile and post-juvenile stage may moderate the variation induced at the pre-juvenile stage. The hypothesis that recruitment can be regulated by starvation during the larval stage was assessed in relation to Hjort's `critical period' and Cushing's `match-mismatch rs hypotheses. The available evidence does not support a major link between food abundance at the time of first feeding, and recruitment (Hjort's `critical period'). The hypothesized relationship between recruitment and the coincidence between the seasonal timing of plankton production and the seasonal abundance of larvae (Cushing's `match-mismatch') is generally supported. However, the relationships are weak and the importance of the strength of the coupling between seasonal cycles in plankton and larval abundance appears to be weaker than had previously been surmised. Recent evidence, which suggests that failure to distinguish between food abundance in the environment and the availability of food to individual larvae may have comprimised the evaluation of these hypotheses, is reviewed. The relationship between mortality due to predation and its potential effects on recruitment was evaluated with reference to two emerging paradigms, the `bigger is better' and the `stage duration' hypotheses. We conclude that failure to fully evaluate the assumptions underlying these hypotheses may have led to erroneous generalizations regarding the importance of size at age/stage and growth rate on the probability of death due to predation. Neither the `bigger is better', nor the `stage duration' hypotheses is unequivocally supported.},

While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of ``unexpected'' events\textemdash that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic\textemdash on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily, decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {El Ni\~no events were first perceived several centuries ago as a dramatic change in the marine resources along the Peruvian coast. It is now recognized as part of the world's largest natural climate fluctuation: the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There is a rapidly growing body of scientific literature showing that ENSO has physical and ecological impacts throughout the Pacific Ocean and more broadly across the other oceanic basins through atmospheric teleconnections. This review details a range of these examples in all major ecosystems impacted by ENSO in the Pacific Ocean. Teleconnections with other basins are also discussed, as are the diversity of changes associated with ENSO phases and their consequences on fisheries sustained by these ecosystems. Information is provided on the emerging complexity of the connection between ENSO and the ocean ecosystems, and particularly the diversity of El Ni\~no types, characterized by eastern and central spatial patterns and differences in intensity. As these mechanisms become better understood, useful predictive capacity for ecosystem and fisheries management will result. However, growing evidences suggest that climate change may have already started interacting with ENSO dynamics and effects, complicating mechanistic understanding.},

  abstract = {In the last five decades for which tuna fishing data are available, the interannual ENSO signal (SOI) and the related Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) suggest two different regimes characterized by higher intensity and frequency of either El Ni\~no or La Ni\~na events. Recent estimates from a statistical population dynamics model (MULTIFAN-CL) suggest that recruitment of three tuna species in the Pacific are correlated with these climate indices. While tropical tuna species like skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) had higher recruitments during El Ni\~no events, the subtropical albacore species (Thunnus alalunga) showed the opposite pattern with low recruitment during El Ni\~no and high recruitment during La Ni\~na. The potential explanatory mechanisms for such relationships between recruitment and climate are investigated with a spatial environmental population model (SEPODYM). The model is a two-dimensional coupled physical\textendash biological interaction model at the ocean basin scale, and contains environmental and spatial components used to constrain the movement and the recruitment of tuna. Input datasets for the model are sea surface temperature, oceanic currents and new primary production that are simulated fields from a three-dimensional coupled physical\textendash biogeochemical model. The hypothesis that the spatial dynamics of temperature, currents (advection), food availability and predation constrain tuna recruitment is evaluated with an application of SEPODYM to skipjack. Simulation results showed that this hypothesis can reproduce fluctuations in the population that are similar to those estimated from the statistical model.},

Although skipjack are distributed in the surface mixed layer throughout the equatorial and subtropical Pacific, catches are highest in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool, a region characterized by low primary productivity rates1 that has the warmest surface waters of the world's oceans (Fig. 1). Assessments of tuna stocks indicate that recent western Pacific skipjack catches approaching one million tonnes annually are sustainable2. The warm pool, which is fundamental to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Earth's climate in general3,4,5, must therefore also provide a habitat capable of supporting this highly productive tuna population. Here we show that apparent spatial shifts in the skipjack population are linked to large zonal displacements of the warm pool that occur during ENSO events5,6. This relationship can be used to predict (several months in advance) the region of highest skipjack abundance, within a fishing ground extending over 6,000\,km along the Equator.},

  abstract = {A feature of the central equatorial Pacific is a strong divergent equatorial upwelling called the cold tongue, which is favorable to the development of a large zonal band with high levels of primary production. Contiguous to the cold tongue, is the western Pacific warm pool, which is characterized by warmer water with lower levels of primary production. At the top of the food web, the tropical tunas are a major component of the pelagic ecosystem and have their maximum biomass in the warm pool. However, during ENSO (El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation) events, variability is observed in both environmental factors and the spatial distribution of tuna. A Spatial Environmental Population Dynamics Model (SEPODYM) is used to assist in the analysis and interpretation of these fishery oceanographic observations. A modelling approach is described and applied to the population and fisheries of skipjack tuna, one of the top predator species with its greatest biomass in the tropical pelagic ecosystem. Environmental variables are used in the model for delineating the spawning area of skipjack, reproducing the transport of its larvae and juveniles, and simulating tuna forage. The forage production is deduced from a simple ecological transfer based on new primary production with biomass calculated as a single population. The model considers an interaction between predicted tuna density and forage density. A habitat index combining temperature preferences with forage distribution is used to constrain the movement of adult tuna. Results of the simulation allow realistic prediction of the large-scale distribution of the species. There is a remarkable out-of-phase pattern linked to ENSO between the western Pacific region and the cold tongue. This pattern is consistent with the observed movements of skipjack.},

  abstract = {An enhanced version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM is presented to describe spatial dynamics of tuna and tuna-like species in the Pacific Ocean at monthly resolution over 1\textdegree{} grid-boxes. The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical\textendash biogeochemical model. This new version of SEAPODYM includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. Once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.},

Our model system includes a global Earth System Model (IPSL-CM5A-LR), the biogeochemical model PISCES and the ecosystem model APECOSM that simulates upper trophic level organisms using a size-based approach and three interactive pelagic communities (epipelagic, migratory and mesopelagic). Analyzing an idealized (e.g., no anthropogenic forcing) 300-yr long pre-industrial simulation, we find that low and high frequency variability is dominant for the large and small organisms, respectively. Our model shows that the size-range exhibiting the largest variability at a given frequency, defined as the resonant range, also depends on the community. At a given frequency, the resonant range of the epipelagic community includes larger organisms than that of the migratory community and similarly, the latter includes larger organisms than the resonant range of the mesopelagic community. This study shows that the simulated temporal variability of marine pelagic organisms' abundance is not only influenced by natural climate fluctuations but also by the structure of the pelagic community. As a consequence, the size- and community-dependent response of marine ecosystems to climate variability could impact the sustainability of fisheries in a warming world.},

Passive larval drift simulations using a dispersal biophysical model showed a large variability in the possible trajectories from spawning to nursery areas and in the predicted ages for larvae arrival on the two nursery sites. The most common ages at arrival obtained in the simulations (20\textendash 60 days) are broadly consistent with previous modeling studies but contrast with the actual ages of the S. aurata post-larvae collected in 2016 and 2017 at time of the lagoon entrances (60\textendash 90 days, from otolith readings). The period between 25 and 70 days being critical for gilthead seabream larvae to acquire sufficient swimming, osmoregulatory, and olfactory abilities to enter coastal lagoons, we argue that ontogenic development plays a crucial role in the transport and local retention of S. aurata larvae in the studied region, explaining the discrepancy between simulation results and observed data.},

Variations in oxygenated vertical habitat space in the upper-ocean can alter interactions between predator and prey, as well as drive changes in the vulnerability of economically important tuna and other pelagic fish to surface fishing gear. Using in situ measurements, we show that ENSO is the primary driver of upper-ocean oxygen partial pressure (pO2) variability on year-to-year time scales in the tropical Pacific. Mechanistically, these pO2 variations are primarily caused by vertical shifts in thermocline depth, which alternately elevate and depress cold, hypoxic waters from the ocean interior depending on the ENSO phase and location. Transport-driven, isopycnal pO2 variations within the thermocline also play an important but secondary role. In the western tropical Pacific, waters within the exclusive economic zones of Palau, Micronesia, Nauru, and the Marshall Islands undergo the greatest variations in oxygenated tuna vertical habitat extent: approximately 19.5 m, 23.9 m, 19.5 m, and 19.3 m, respectively, between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na phases. Oxygen thus plays an important role in altering available tuna vertical habitat space between different phases of ENSO.},

  abstract = {Historically, the NEMO system (Madec et al. 1998) was built for climate studies using strong hypothesis on the dynamics, such as the ``rigid lid'' approximation, which eliminates the fast gravity waves. A first improvement (Roullet and Madec 2000) was made by implementing a free surface while filtering the fast external gravity waves, which allows one to keep a large time step. Roullet and Madec (2000) compared a linear formulation (with fixed volume) with a non-linear one (with a variable first level thickness), and concluded that the linear formulation was the best compromise for climate (the linear formulation does not strictly conserve the ocean salt content unlike the non-linear formulation, but the differences were not large enough to play a large role in the experiments of Roullet and Madec (2000)). People interested in regional and/or coastal studies must simulate rapidly phenomena with short spatial scales, such as tidal waves. With the filtering scheme of Roullet and Madec (2000), these phenomena are very rapidly damped, or not simulated at all (Talandier et al. 2003). That's why a time-splitting scheme has recently been implemented, which allows the representation of the fast dynamics, while keeping a large time step (Bessi\`eres 2003). But this is not sufficient: although the free surface is implemented, the vertical grid of the model is fixed in time. This fact does not allow a good representation of tidal waves, and as mentioned above it precludes an exact conservation of the salt content. This is why the decision was made, as part of the MERSEA European project, to implement a variable volume in the NEMO system. In this report, we first review the representation of the free surface in the NEMO system, with the different schemes available at the present time (chapter1). Then we introduce the equations of the free surface and the implementations induced by the variable volume (chapter 2). We present two kind of experiments in order to investigate the behaviour of the model with the variable volume implemented; chapter 3 focusses on the conservation of salt content, and chapter 4 on the representation of a gravity wave.},

  abstract = {With the development of open source community, the software ecosystem has become a popular perspective in the research on software development process and environment. Software productivity is an important evaluation indicator of the software ecosystem health. A successful software ecosystem relies on long-term and stable production activities by the users, which ensures that the software ecosystem can continuously provide the value needed by users. Therefore, the measurement of software ecosystem productivity can help maintain the user development efficiency and the stability of the software ecosystem. However, there is still little literature on the productivity of open source software ecosystems. By analogy with the natural ecosystem, this paper gives the relevant definitions of software ecosystem productivity and analyzes the factors affecting the productivity of software ecosystem. Based on the factors of the ecosystem productivity and their interrelationships, this paper establishes a software ecosystem productivity model and takes the GitHub platform as an example for detailed analysis and explanation. The results show that the model can better explain the factors affecting the productivity of software ecosystems. It is helpful for the research on the measurement of the software ecosystem health and the software development efficiency.},

  abstract = {The collapse of marine fisheries had caused a cascade of dramatic ecological, social and economic consequences. Recognizing the complex nature of the fisheries collapses, two basic minimum elements should be included in fishery models. First, the dynamics of the fish population and second the changes in the fishing effort that are co-determined by the harvest and economic forces. The rapid and abrupt shifts in abundance exhibited by some marine fish populations can be driven by the fishing fleet behaving like generalist predators. Here we develop a population dynamic model with negative feedback in the fish stock and a sigmoid functional response of the fishing effort, we assume that the rate of change in effort from year to year is a positive function of fishery revenue, but is negatively influenced by fishing costs which are proportional to the annual ratio between fishing effort/stock size. We use this model to consider how changes in the fishing effort driven by ecological and economic forces can generate the observed large abrupt shifts in the abundance of the jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) stock at south-eastern Pacific. Our model predict that jack-mackerel stock dynamics can have alternate stable states. Our simple bio-economic model allows us to explore some management responses in a heuristic manner, where the most critical element seems to be the combination of an n-shaped isocline for fish stock growth and a slanted isocline of fishing effort whose slope is highly sensitive to changes in the profitability of the fishery.},

  abstract = {The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) produces global marine environment conditions that can cause changes in abundance and distribution of distant fish populations worldwide. Understanding mechanisms acting locally on fish population dynamics is crucial to develop forecast skill useful for fisheries management. The present work addresses the role played by ENSO on the round sardinella population biomass and distribution in the central-southern portion of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CCUS). A combined physical-biogeochemical framework is used to understand the climate influence on the hydrodynamical conditions in the study area. Then, an evolutionary individual-based model is used to simulate the round sardinella spatio-temporal biomass variability. According to model experiments, anomalous oceanographic conditions forced by El Ni\~no along the African coast cause anomalies in the latitudinal migration pattern of the species. A robust anomalous increase and decrease of the simulated round sardinella biomass is identified in winter off the Cape Blanc and the Saharan coast region, respectively, in response to El Ni\~no variations. The resultant anomalous pattern is an alteration of the normal migration between the Saharan and the Mauritanian waters. It is primarily explained by the modulating role that El Ni\~no exerts on the currents off Cape Blanc, modifying therefore the normal migration of round sardinella in the search of acceptable temperature conditions. This climate signature can be potentially predicted up to six months in advance based on El Ni\~no conditions in the Pacific.},

Two effects were identified from a time series analysis: (1) relatively low CPUE followed the onset of ENSO episodes with 8 and 4yr time lag in fishing grounds between 10\textdegree S and 30\textdegree S and south of 30\textdegree S, respectively; and (2) towards the beginning of ENSO episodes CPUE was slightly higher in fishing grounds between the equator and 10\textdegree S. The time lag of the first effect corresponds to the time intervals that would be expected before the recruitment for the fish spawned during ENSO episodes. The second effect is interpreted as a result of the anomalous temperature structure of the seawater. The rise of the mixed layer depth (MLD) in the equatorial region as well as the narrowing volume of water comprising the albacore's temperature preference in the subtropical region would both be expected to lead to a (slight) increase in the hook rate of albacore in the two regions.},

The method involves defining an analytical set of mesh parallels in the stereographic polar plan, computing the associated set of mesh meridians, and projecting the resulting mesh onto the sphere. The set of mesh parallels proposed here is defined as a series of embedded circles. The resulting mesh presents no loss of continuity in either the mesh lines or the scale factors over the whole ocean domain, as the mesh is not a composite mesh. Thus, the Bering Strait can be opened without specific treatment. The equator is a mesh line, which provides a better numerical solution for equatorial dynamics. The resolution can be easily controlled through the definition of three analytical functions which can increase resolution and/or maintain a low ratio of anisotropy. The mesh has been implemented in the LODYC general circulation ocean model. Results of a semi-diagnostic simulation are shown.},

  abstract = {Schools, shoals and swarms are pervasive in the oceans. They have to provide very strong advantages to have been selected and generalized in the course of evolution. Auto-organized groups are usually assumed to provide facilitated encounters of reproduction partners, improved protection against predation, better foraging efficiency, and hydrodynamic gains. However, present theories regarding their evolutionary advantages do not provide an unambiguous explanation to their universality. In particular, the mechanisms commonly proposed to explain grouping provide little support to the formation of very large groups that are common in the sea (e.g. Rieucau et al., 2014). From literature review, data analysis and using a simple mathematical model, I show that large auto-organized groups appear at high population density while only small groups or dispersed individuals remain at low population density. Following, an analysis of tuna tagging data and simple theoretical developments show that large groups are likely to expose individuals to a dramatic decrease of individual foraging success and simultaneous increase of predatory and disease mortality, while small groups avoid those adverse feedbacks and provide maximum foraging success and protection against predation, as it is usually assumed. This would create an emergent density-dependent regulation of marine populations, preventing them from outbursts at high density, and protecting them at low density. This would be a major contribution to their resilience and a crucial process of ecosystems dynamics. A two-step evolutionary process acting at the individual level is proposed to explain how this apparently suicidal behaviour could have been selected and generalized. It explains how grouping would have permitted the emergence of extremely high fecundity life histories, despite their notorious propensity to destabilize populations. The potential implications of the ``grouping feedback'' on population resilience, ecosystem stability and the persistence of marine biodiversity are discussed. The risk of harvesting marine species with fishing gears that enable catching dispersed individuals (such as longline, gillnet, trawl or using fishing aggregative devices for instance) is underlined. Finally, tropical tunas are used to exemplify the potential importance of schooling in shaping complex life histories and species interaction.},

  abstract = {Individual metabolism, predator\textendash prey relationships, and the role of biodiversity are major factors underlying the dynamics of food webs and their response to environmental variability. Despite their crucial, complementary and interacting influences, they are usually not considered simultaneously in current marine ecosystem models. In an attempt to fill this gap and determine if these factors and their interaction are sufficient to allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge, we formulate a mathematical model of the size-structured dynamics of marine communities which integrates mechanistically individual, population and community levels. The model represents the transfer of energy generated in both time and size by an infinite number of interacting fish species spanning from very small to very large species. It is based on standard individual level assumptions of the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB) as well as important ecological processes such as opportunistic size-based predation and competition for food. Resting on the inter-specific body-size scaling relationships of the DEB theory, the diversity of life-history traits (i.e. biodiversity) is explicitly integrated. The stationary solutions of the model as well as the transient solutions arising when environmental signals (e.g. variability of primary production and temperature) propagate through the ecosystem are studied using numerical simulations. It is shown that in the absence of density-dependent feedback processes, the model exhibits unstable oscillations. Density-dependent schooling probability and schooling-dependent predatory and disease mortalities are proposed to be important stabilizing factors allowing stationary solutions to be reached. At the community level, the shape and slope of the obtained quasi-linear stationary spectrum matches well with empirical studies. When oscillations of primary production are simulated, the model predicts that the variability propagates along the spectrum in a given frequency-dependent size range before decreasing for larger sizes. At the species level, the simulations show that small and large species dominate the community successively (small species being more abundant at small sizes and large species being more abundant at large sizes) and that the total biomass of a species decreases with its maximal size which again corroborates empirical studies. Our results indicate that the simultaneous consideration of individual growth and reproduction, size-structured trophic interactions, the diversity of life-history traits and a density-dependent stabilizing process allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge without any arbitrary prescription. As a logical consequence of our model construction and a basis for future studies, we define the function {$\Phi$} as the relative contribution of each species to the total biomass of the ecosystem, for any given size. We argue that this function is a measure of the functional role of biodiversity characterizing the impact of the structure of the community (its species composition) on its function (the relative proportions of losses, dissipation and biological work).},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations using a physiologically-based model of marine ecosystem size spectrum are conducted to study the influence of primary production and temperature on energy flux through marine ecosystems. In stable environmental conditions, the model converges toward a stationary linear log\textendash log size-spectrum. In very productive ecosystems, the model predicts that small size classes are depleted by predation, leading to a curved size-spectrum. It is shown that the absolute level of primary production does not affect the slope of the stationary size-spectrum but has a nonlinear effect on its intercept and hence on the total biomass of consumer organisms (the carrying capacity). Three domains are distinguished: at low primary production, total biomass is independent from production changes because loss processes dominate dissipative processes (biological work); at high production, ecosystem biomass is proportional to primary production because dissipation dominates losses; an intermediate transition domain characterizes mid-production ecosystems. Our results enlighten the paradox of the very high ecosystem biomass/primary production ratios which are observed in poor oceanic regions. Thus, maximal dissipation (least action and low ecosystem biomass/primary production ratios) is reached at high primary production levels when the ecosystem is efficient in transferring energy from small sizes to large sizes. Conversely, least dissipation (most action and high ecosystem biomass/primary production ratios) characterizes the simulated ecosystem at low primary production levels when it is not efficient in dissipating energy. Increasing temperature causes enhanced predation mortality and decreases the intercept of the stationary size spectrum, i.e., the total ecosystem biomass. Total biomass varies as the inverse of the Arrhenius coefficient in the loss domain. This approximation is no longer true in the dissipation domain where nonlinear dissipation processes dominate over linear loss processes. Our results suggest that in a global warming context, at constant primary production, a 2\textendash 4\textdegree C warming would lead to a 20\textendash 43\% decrease of ecosystem biomass in oligotrophic regions and to a 15\textendash 32\% decrease of biomass in eutrophic regions. Oscillations of primary production or temperature induce waves which propagate along the size-spectrum and which amplify until a ``resonant range'' which depends on the period of the environmental oscillations. Small organisms oscillate in phase with producers and are bottom-up controlled by primary production oscillations. In the ``resonant range'', prey and predators oscillate out of phase with alternating periods of top-down and bottom-up controls. Large organisms are not influenced by bottom-up effects of high frequency phytoplankton variability or by oscillations of temperature.},

The uptake and use of energy for growth, maintenance and reproduction by the organisms are modelled according to the DEB (dynamic energy budget) theory (Kooijmann, 2000) and the size-structured nature of predation is explicit. The pelagic community is divided into epipelagic and mesopelagic groups, the latter being subdivided into vertically migrant and non-migrant species. The model is mass-conservative. Energy is provided as the basis of the model through primary production and transferred through 3D spatially explicit size-spectra.

ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific through interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, but its environmental and socioeconomic impacts are felt worldwide. Spurred on by the powerful 1997\textendash 1998 El Ni\~no, efforts to understand the causes and consequences of ENSO have greatly expanded in the past few years. These efforts reveal the breadth of ENSO's influence on the Earth system and the potential to exploit its predictability for societal benefit. However, many intertwined issues regarding ENSO dynamics, impacts, forecasting, and applications remain unresolved. Research to address these issues will not only lead to progress across a broad range of scientific disciplines but also provide an opportunity to educate the public and policy makers about the importance of climate variability and change in the modern world.},

  abstract = {Starving ocean productivity Projected increases in greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a thousand years or more. As the climate warms, westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere will strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters will warm, and sea ice will disappear. Moore et al. suggest that one effect of these changes will be a dramatic decrease in marine biological productivity (see the Perspective by Laufk\"otter and Gruber). This decrease will result from a global-scale redistribution of nutrients, with a net transfer to the deep ocean. By 2300, this could drive declines in fisheries yields by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic. Science, this issue p. 1139; see also p. 1103 Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30\textdegree S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41\%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower\textendash trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.

This period coincides with the peak of one of the strongest El Ni\~no events during December 1997 and the La Ni\~na of 1998 that appeared dramatically in less than a month as a sea surface temperature (SST) change of over 6\textdegree C in the central equatorial Pacific during June 1998. The tropical Indian Ocean also underwent a highly anomalous series of events with negative SST anomalies (SSTA) of over 3\textdegree C in the eastern equatorial and coastal regions during October-December 1997 and warm SSTA in the west that peaked at over 2\textdegree C during February 1998. The ocean color variability is interpreted using other satellite data such as sea level from TOPEX/Poseidon and also in terms of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the region from simulations with an ocean general circulation model. The El Ni\~no-related reductions in equatorial production and the off-equatorial increase in biological activity, and their basin scale evolution is clearly seen for the first time. Persistent northerly wind anomalies resulted in a northward shift of the equatorial divergence and the upwelling Kelvin wave which signalled the end of the 1997\textendash 1998 El Ni\~no. The anomalous surface chlorophyll associated with this Kelvin wave was also clearly shifted north of the equator by nearly 300 km and appeared more than a month before the negative sea level anomalies seen by TOPEX/Poseidon. On the equator near 165\textdegree E, the disappearance of the barrier layer appeared to coincide with a localized bloom that occurred in response to the easterly wind bursts over the western Pacific that lasted from December 1997 through the boreal summer. The ecosystem response to the cold La Ni\~na conditions is clearly seen as elevated chlorophyll during the boreal summer of 1998 in the equatorial Pacific cold tongue region. In the Indian Ocean, an anomalous phytoplankton bloom was observed by SeaWiFS during October-December 1997 coincident with the anomalous upwelling in the eastern equatorial region and off the coast of Sumatra. A stronger than normal northeast monsoon is seen as higher than climatological values of surface chlorophyll. The open ocean Ekman pumping and the shoaling of the thermocline near 60\textdegree E and 10\textdegree S and the eastward extension of mixed layer entrainment in the same latitude band is seen as a region of higher biological activity during the boreal summer.},

In particular, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the equatorial Pacific cold tongue are larger in magnitude during El Ni\~no compared to La Ni\~na, resulting in positive skewness of interannual SST variations. The associated atmospheric deep convection anomalies are displaced eastward during El Ni\~no compared to La Ni\~na because of the nonlinear atmospheric response to SST. In addition to these well-known features, an analysis of observational data for the past century shows that there is a robust asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. Most El Ni\~nos and La Ni\~nas develop in late boreal spring/summer, when the climatological cold tongue is intensifying, and they peak near the end of the calendar year. After the mature phase, El Ni\~nos tend to decay rapidly by next summer, but many La Ni\~nas persist through the following year and often reintensify in the subsequent winter. Throughout the analysis period, this asymmetric feature is evident for strong events in which Ni\~no-3.4 SST anomalies exceed one standard deviation in December. Seasonally stratified composite analysis suggests that the eastward displacement of atmospheric deep convection anomalies during El Ni\~no enables surface winds in the western equatorial Pacific to be more affected by remote forcing from the Indian Ocean, which acts to terminate the Pacific events.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {When models are aimed to support decision-making, their credibility is essential to consider. Model fitting to observed data is one major criterion to assess such credibility. However, due to the complexity of ecosystem models making their calibration more challenging, the scientific community has given more attention to the exploration of model behavior than to a rigorous comparison to observations. This work highlights some issues related to the comparison of complex ecosystem models to data and proposes a methodology for a sequential multi-phases calibration (or parameter estimation) of ecosystem models. We first propose two criteria to classify the parameters of a model: the model dependency and the time variability of the parameters. Then, these criteria and the availability of approximate initial estimates are used as decision rules to determine which parameters need to be estimated, and their precedence order in the sequential calibration process. The end-to-end (E2E) ecosystem model ROMS-PISCES-OSMOSE applied to the Northern Humboldt Current Ecosystem is used as an illustrative case study. The model is calibrated using an evolutionary algorithm and a likelihood approach to fit time series data of landings, abundance indices and catch at length distributions from 1992 to 2008. Testing different calibration schemes regarding the number of phases, the precedence of the parameters' estimation, and the consideration of time varying parameters, the results show that the multiple-phase calibration conducted under our criteria allowed to improve the model fit.},

  abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea (MS) is a semi-enclosed sea characterized by a zonal west-east gradient of oligotrophy, where microbial growth is controlled by phosphate availability in most situations. External inputs of nutrients including Gibraltar inputs, river inputs and atmospheric deposition are therefore of major importance for the biogeochemistry of the MS. The latter has long been considered to be driven mainly by nutrient exchanges at Gibraltar. However, recent studies indicate that river inputs significantly affect nutrients concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea, although their resulting impact on its biogeochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, our aim was to help fill this knowledge gap by addressing the large-scale and long-term impact of variations in river inputs on the biogeochemistry of the Mediterranean Sea over the last decades, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical 3D model (NEMO-MED12/Eco3M-Med). As a first result, it has been shown by the model that the strong diminution (60\%) of phosphate (PO4) in river inputs into the Mediterranean Sea since the end of the 1980s induced a significant lowering of PO4 availability in the sub-surface layer of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin (EMB). One of the main consequences of PO4 diminution is the rise, never previously documented, of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the surface layer (by 20\% on average over the EMB). Another main result concerns the gradual deepening of the top of the phosphacline during the period studied, thus generating a shift between the top of the nitracline and the top of the phosphacline in the EMB. This shift has already been observed in situ and documented in literature, but we propose here a new explanation for its occurrence in the EMB. The last main result is the evidence of the decline in abundance and the reduction of size of copepods calculated by the model over the years 1985\textendash 2010, that could partially explain the reduction in size of anchovy and sardine recently recorded in the MS. In this study, it is shown for the first time that the variations in river inputs that occurred in the last decades may have significantly altered the biogeochemical cycles of two key elements (P and C), in particular in the EMB. To conclude, the magnitude of the biogeochemical changes induced by river inputs and runoff alone over the last thirty years clearly calls for the use of realistic scenarios of river inputs along with climate scenarios for coupled physical-biogeochemical forecasts in the MS.},

  abstract = {The eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool corresponds to the separation between the warm, rainfall-induced low-salinity waters of the warm pool and the cold, high-salinity upwelled waters of the cold tongue in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific. Although not well defined in sea surface temperature (SST), this eastern edge is characterized by a sharp salinity front that is trapped to the equator. Several studies, using numerous in situ and satellite data and three classes of ocean models, indicate that this front is the result of the zonal convergence of the western and central Pacific water masses into the eastern edge of the warm pool. This occurs through the frequent encounter of the eastward jets in the warm pool and the westward South Equatorial Current in the cold tongue. The notable and alternate variations of these wind-driven zonal currents are trapped to the equator and are chiefly interannual in the vicinity of the edge. Consequently, the Eastern Warm Pool Convergence Zone (EWPCZ) is subject to eastward or westward displacements over several thousands of kilometers along the equatorial band, in synchrony with the warm phase (El Ni\~no) and the cold phase (La Ni\~na) of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Zonal advection appears to be the predominant mechanism for the ENSO displacements of the eastern edge of the warm and fresh pool. The existence of the EWPCZ and its ENSO displacements have significant effects on the physics of the tropical Pacific and on related biogeochemical phenomena. The EWPCZ is important for the formation of the barrier layer in the isothermal layer of the warm pool. Its zonal displacements control SST in the central equatorial Pacific, which in turn drives the surface winds and atmospheric convection (and vice versa). Hence the central equatorial Pacific is a key region for ENSO coupled interactions. All these findings from several studies and additional analyses lead to a revision of the delayed action oscillator theory of ENSO. The existence of the EWPCZ and its zonal displacements are also reasons for the ENSO variations in production and exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere over the equatorial Pacific. The zone of one-dimensional convergence seems to congregate the world's most important tuna fishery in the western equatorial Pacific, and its displacements are likely the reason for this fishery to move zonally over thousands of kilometers in phase with ENSO.},

  abstract = {Oceanic phytoplankton respond rapidly to a complex spectrum of climate-driven perturbations, confounding attempts to isolate the principal causes of observed changes. A dominant mode of variability in the Earth-climate system is that generated by the El Ni\~no phenomenon. Marked variations are observed in the centroid of anomalous warming in the Equatorial Pacific under El Ni\~no, associated with quite different alterations in environmental and biological properties. Here, using observational and reanalysis datasets, we differentiate the regional physical forcing mechanisms, and compile a global atlas of associated impacts on oceanic phytoplankton caused by two extreme types of El Ni\~no. We find robust evidence that during Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP) types of El Ni\~no, impacts on phytoplankton can be felt everywhere, but tend to be greatest in the tropics and subtropics, encompassing up to 67\% of the total affected areas, with the remaining 33\% being areas located in high-latitudes. Our analysis also highlights considerable and sometimes opposing regional effects. During EP El Ni\~no, we estimate decreases of -56 TgC/y in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, and -82 TgC/y in the western Indian Ocean, and increase of +13 TgC/y in eastern Indian Ocean, whereas during CP El Ni\~no, we estimate decreases -68 TgC/y in the tropical western Pacific Ocean and -10 TgC/y in the central Atlantic Ocean. We advocate that analysis of the dominant mechanisms forcing the biophysical under El Ni\~no variability may provide a useful guide to improve our understanding of projected changes in the marine ecosystem in a warming climate and support development of adaptation and mitigation plans.},

HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

Modeled biogenic carbon fluxes in the ocean often match measured data poorly and part of this could be because small copepods ({$<$}2 mm) are modeled as unicellular feeders grazing on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. The most abundant copepods from a seasonal upwelling region of the Eastern North Atlantic were sorted, and a molecular method was applied to copepod gut contents to evaluate the extent of metazoan predation under two oceanographic conditions, a trophic pathway not accounted for in global models. Scaling up the results obtained herein, based on published field and laboratory estimates, suggests that small copepods could ingest 1.79\textendash 27.20 gigatons C/year globally. This ignored metazoan-copepod link could increase current estimates of biogeochemical fluxes (remineralization, respiration, and the biological pump) and export to higher trophic levels by 15.6\%\textendash 24.4\%. It could also account for global discrepancies between measured daily ingestion and copepod metabolic demand/growth. The inclusion of metazoan predation into global models could provide a more realistic role of the copepods in the ocean and if these preliminary data hold true at larger sample sizes and scales, the implications would be substantial at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Unusual large-scale accumulations of phytoplankton occurred across 10,000 km of the equatorial Pacific during the 1998 transition from El Ni\~no to La Ni\~na. The forcing and dynamics of these phytoplankton blooms were studied using satellite-based observations of sea surface height, temperature and chlorophyll, and mooring-based observations of winds, hydrography and ocean currents. During the bloom period, the thermocline (nutricline) was anomalously shallow across the equatorial Pacific. The relative importance of processes that enhanced nutrient flux into the euphotic zone differed between the western and eastern regions of the blooms. In the western bloom region, the important vertical processes were turbulent vertical mixing and wind-driven upwelling. In contrast, the important processes in the eastern bloom region were wave-forced shoaling of nutrient source waters directly into the euphotic zone, along-isopycnal upwelling, and wind-driven upwelling. Advection by the Equatorial Undercurrent spread the largest bloom 4500 km east of where it began, and advection by meridional currents of tropical instability waves transported the bloom hundreds of kilometers north and south of the equator. Many processes influenced the intricate development of these massive biological events. Diverse observations and novel analysis methods of this work advance the conceptual framework for understanding the complex dynamics and ecology of the equatorial Pacific.},

Paradigms based on late 20th century observations suggest that large-scale forcing controls decadal-scale fluctuations of anchovy and sardine across different boundary currents of the Pacific. We develop records of anchovy and sardine fluctuations since 1860 AD using fish scales from multiple sites containing laminated sediments and compare them with Pacific basin-scale and regional indices of ocean climate variability. Our records reveal two main anchovy and sardine phases with a timescale that is not consistent with previously proposed periodicities. Rather, the regime shifts in the HCS are related to 3D habitat changes driven by changes in upwelling intensity from both regional and large-scale forcing. Moreover, we show that a long-term increase in coastal upwelling translates via a bottom-up mechanism to top predators suggesting that the warming climate, at least up to the start of the 21st century, was favorable for fishery productivity in the HCS.},

  abstract = {Ocean colour is recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS); and spectrally-resolved water-leaving radiances (or remote-sensing reflectances) in the visible domain, and chlorophyll-a concentration are identified as required ECV products. Time series of the products at the global scale and at high spatial resolution, derived from ocean-colour data, are key to studying the dynamics of phytoplankton at seasonal and inter-annual scales; their role in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; the modulation of how phytoplankton distribute solar-induced heat in the upper layers of the ocean; and the response of the marine ecosystem to climate variability and change. However, generating a long time series of these products from ocean-colour data is not a trivial task: algorithms that are best suited for climate studies have to be selected from a number that are available for atmospheric correction of the satellite signal and for retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration; since satellites have a finite life span, data from multiple sensors have to be merged to create a single time series, and any uncorrected inter-sensor biases could introduce artefacts in the series, e.g., different sensors monitor radiances at different wavebands such that producing a consistent time series of reflectances is not straightforward. Another requirement is that the products have to be validated against in situ observations. Furthermore, the uncertainties in the products have to be quantified, ideally on a pixel-by-pixel basis, to facilitate applications and interpretations that are consistent with the quality of the data. This paper outlines an approach that was adopted for generating an ocean-colour time series for climate studies, using data from the MERIS (MEdium spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor of the European Space Agency; the SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor) and MODIS-Aqua (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua) sensors from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA); and VIIRS (Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA). The time series now covers the period from late 1997 to end of 2018. To ensure that the products meet, as well as possible, the requirements of the user community, marine-ecosystem modellers, and remote-sensing scientists were consulted at the outset on their immediate and longer-term requirements as well as on their expectations of ocean-colour data for use in climate research. Taking the user requirements into account, a series of objective criteria were established, against which available algorithms for processing ocean-colour data were evaluated and ranked. The algorithms that performed best with respect to the climate user requirements were selected to process data from the satellite sensors. Remote-sensing reflectance data from MODIS-Aqua, MERIS, and VIIRS were band-shifted to match the wavebands of SeaWiFS. Overlapping data were used to correct for mean biases between sensors at every pixel. The remote-sensing reflectance data derived from the sensors were merged, and the selected in-water algorithm was applied to the merged data to generate maps of chlorophyll concentration, inherent optical properties at SeaWiFS wavelengths, and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. The merged products were validated against in situ observations. The uncertainties established on the basis of comparisons with in situ data were combined with an optical classification of the remote-sensing reflectance data using a fuzzy-logic approach, and were used to generate uncertainties (root mean square difference and bias) for each product at each pixel.},

  abstract = {We compared the estimates of surface drifter trajectories from 1 to 7 days in the equatorial Atlantic over an 18-month period with five eddying ocean general circulation model (OGCM) reanalyses and one observational product. The cumulative distribution of trajectory error was estimated using over 7,000 days of drifter trajectories. The observational product had smaller errors than any of the individual OGCM reanalyses. Three strategies for improving trajectory estimates using the ensemble of five operational ocean analysis and forecasting products were explored: two methods using a multi-model ensemble estimate and also spatial low-pass filtering. The results were insensitive to the method used to create the ensemble estimates, and by most measures, the results were better than the observational product. Comparison of relative skill of the various OGCM reanalyses suggested promising avenues for exploration for further improvements: forcing with higher frequency wind stress and quality control of input data. One of the lowest horizontal resolution OGCMs, with 1/4\textdegree{} longitude horizontal resolution, made the best trajectory estimates. The individual OGCMs were dominated by errors at spatial scales smaller than about 100 to 200 km, i.e., less than the local deformation radius. But buried in those errors were valuable signals that could be retrieved by combining all the OGCM velocity fields to produce a multi-model ensemble-based estimate. This estimate had skill down to spatial scales about 75 km. Results from this study are consistent with previous work showing that ensemble-mean forecast skill is superior to individual forecasts.},

Satellite bio-optical algorithms have allowed us to derive complex biological parameters from the surface ocean via remote sensing, providing a scientific platform to investigate biological relationships with climate indices. Studies have focused in-depth on contrasting types of the ENSO types with various physical parameters with only a few recent studies focusing on satellite-observed chlorophyll-a, with however none focusing on phytoplankton biomass itself. Here we review the types of ENSO and its effect on backscattering-based biomass using different statistical techniques, over the 1997-2007 period. We also contrast the responses of phytoplankton biomass with those of chlorophyll-a and their physical drivers in various types of ENSO.

  abstract = {An individual-based model named OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems Exploitation) is used to investigate the dynamics of exploited marine fish communities. It allows the representation of age- and size-structured populations comprised of groups of individuals that interact within a spatialized food web. Within each group, which constitutes the basic interaction entity (the `super-individual' in individual-based modelling terminology), fish belong to the same species, have similar biological parameters and behaviour rules. Somatic growth, reproduction, predation and starvation processes are modelled. Two rules apply for the predation process: for a given fish group, prey selection depends both on the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the predator and its prey, and on the respective lengths of the prey versus the predator. Thus, fish feed regardless of the taxonomy of their prey. The strength of both predation and competition relationships therefore vary according to changes in relative species abundance. Preliminary investigations are conducted on a theoretical community comprising seven interacting species. The simulation results show how community stability can emerge from variability in species biomass. It is thus suggested that size-based trophic interactions, along with the existence of multiple weak links and species redundancy, favour community persistence and stability.

The exclusive economic zones of South Pacific Islands and territories are home to major international exploitable stocks of albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga); however the impact of climatic variations on these stocks is not fully understood. This study was aimed at determining the climatic variables which have impact on the time series stock fluctuation pattern of albacore tuna stock in the Eastern and Western South Pacific Ocean which was divided into three zones. The relationship of the climatic variables for the global mean land and ocean temperature index (LOTI), the Pacific warm pool index (PWI) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) was investigated against the albacore tuna catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series in Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 of the South Pacific Ocean from 1957 to 2008. From the results it was observed that LOTI, PWI and PDO at different lag periods exhibited significant correlation with albacore tuna CPUE for all three areas. LOTI, PWI and PDO were used as independent variables to develop suitable stock reproduction models for the trajectory of albacore tuna CPUE in Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3. Model selection was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), R2 values and significant parameter estimates at p {$<$} 0.05. The final models for albacore tuna CPUE in all three zones incorporated all three independent variables of LOTI, PWI and PDO. From the findings it can be said that the climatic conditions of LOTI, PWI and PDO play significant roles in structuring the stock dynamics of the albacore tuna in the Eastern and Western South Pacific Ocean. It is imperative to take these factors into account when making management decisions for albacore tuna in these areas.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based management of marine fisheries requires the use of simulation modelling to investigate the system-level impact of candidate fisheries management strategies. However, testing of fundamental assumptions such as system structure or process formulations is rarely done. In this study, we compare the output of three different ecosystem models (Atlantis, Ecopath with Ecosim, and OSMOSE) applied to the same ecosystem (the southern Benguela), to explore which ecosystem effects of fishing are most sensitive to model uncertainty. We subjected the models to two contrasting fishing pressure scenarios, applying high fishing pressure to either small pelagic fish or to adult hake. We compared the resulting model behaviour at a system level, and also at the level of model groups. We analysed the outputs in terms of various commonly used ecosystem indicators, and found some similarities in the overall behaviour of the models, despite major differences in model formulation and assumptions. Direction of change in system-level indicators was consistent for all models under the hake pressure scenario, although discrepancies emerged under the small-pelagic-fish scenario. Studying biomass response of individual model groups was key to understanding more integrated system-level metrics. All three models are based on existing knowledge of the system, and the convergence of model results increases confidence in the robustness of the model outputs. Points of divergence in the model results suggest important areas of future study. The use of feeding guilds to provide indicators for fish species at an aggregated level was explored, and proved to be an interesting alternative to aggregation by trophic level.},

  abstract = {The effects of climate and fishing on marine ecosystems have usually been studied separately, but their interactions make ecosystem dynamics difficult to understand and predict. Of particular interest to management, the potential synergism or antagonism between fishing pressure and climate forcing is analysed in this paper, using an end-to-end ecosystem model of the southern Benguela ecosystem, built from coupling hydrodynamic, biogeochemical and multispecies fish models (ROMS-N2P2Z2D2-OSMOSE). Scenarios of different intensities of upwelling-favourable wind stress combined with scenarios of fishing top-predator fish were tested. Analyses of isolated drivers show that the bottom-up effect of the climate forcing propagates up the food chain whereas the top-down effect of fishing cascades down to zooplankton in unfavourable environmental conditions but dampens before it reaches phytoplankton. When considering both climate and fishing drivers together, it appears that top-down control dominates the link between top-predator fish and forage fish, whereas interactions between the lower trophic levels are dominated by bottom-up control. The forage fish functional group appears to be a central component of this ecosystem, being the meeting point of two opposite trophic controls. The set of combined scenarios shows that fishing pressure and upwelling-favourable wind stress have mostly dampened effects on fish populations, compared to predictions from the separate effects of the stressors. Dampened effects result in biomass accumulation at the top predator fish level but a depletion of biomass at the forage fish level. This should draw our attention to the evolution of this functional group, which appears as both structurally important in the trophic functioning of the ecosystem, and very sensitive to climate and fishing pressures. In particular, diagnoses considering fishing pressure only might be more optimistic than those that consider combined effects of fishing and environmental variability.},

  abstract = {Modeling the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions between individuals allows the food web structure to emerge from local interactions, which constitutes a prerequisite for assessing how marine ecosystems respond to various anthropogenic pressures. Using a multispecies spatially explicit individual-based model, the emergence of trophic patterns was explored in the eastern English Channel ecosystem, where pelagic-benthic trophic coupling was recently studied empirically. The OSMOSE model was applied to this ecosystem by explicitly representing the life cycle of 13 fish species and one squid group, forced by pelagic and benthic prey fields that are variable over time and space. A matrix defining possible accessibilities between life stages was added to the model to link benthic and pelagic communities through overlap of vertical distribution. After optimizing some parameters of the model to represent the average state of the fish community during the 2000\textendash 2009 period, the simulated trophic structure was explored and compared to empirical data. The simulated and stable-isotope-derived trophic levels of fish were in relatively good agreement. Intraspecific variability of the trophic level is high in the five stable-isotope datasets but is well encompassed by the model. Despite the hypothesis of opportunistic size-based predation, the simulation showed a decreasing trend of trophic level with size for four benthic species, a pattern observed empirically for a different set of species in the ecosystem. Model exploration showed that this emerging pattern varies spatially and is both explained by the spatial variability of prey availability and by the independence of trophic and size structures of benthic invertebrates. The combination of individual-based models, stomach contents and intrinsic tracers, such as stable isotopes, appears to be a promising tool to better understand the causes of observed trophic patterns.},

  abstract = {In order to better understand ecosystem functioning under simultaneous pressures (e.g. both climate change and fishing pressures), integrated modelling approaches are advocated. We developed an end-to-end model of the southern Benguela ecosystem by coupling the high trophic level model OSMOSE with a biophysical model (ROMS-N2P2Z2D2). OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies, individual-based model simulating the whole life cycle of fish with fish schools interacting through opportunistic and size-based predation. It is linked to the biogeochemical model through the predation process; plankton groups are food for fish and fish apply a predation mortality on plankton. Here we describe the two-way coupling between the models and follow a pattern-oriented modelling approach to validate the simulations. At the individual level, model outputs are consistent with observed diets for several species from small pelagic fish to top predatory fish, although biases emerge from underestimation of macrozooplankton and lack of vertical structure. At the population level, the seasonality of the size structure is similar between the model and data. At the community level, the modelled trophic structure is consistent with the knowledge available for this ecosystem. The structure of the foodweb is an emergent property of the model, showing trophic links between species, their strength and the strong connectivity observed. We also highlight the capacity of this model for tracking indicators at various hierarchical levels.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of size-based, species-based, and trophodynamic indicators is examined for the fish community of the southern Benguela ecosystem (South Africa) through simulations of different fishing scenarios using the multispecies model OSMOSE. The simulations suggest that it may be erroneous to consider one absolute reference direction of change for any indicator because the direction of change is specific to both the multispecies assemblage and the fishing scenario considered. The analysis of species versus community indicators is helpful for understanding which processes drive the emergent properties of the ecosystem. Informative about the structure and state of the ecosystem, both types of indicators weighted by biomass or by abundance should be used to evaluate ecosystem changes. Indicators characterizing size distribution (e.g., slope of size spectrum) appear to be more helpful in distinguishing the cause of ecosystem changes than mean community indicators because their response is specific to the fishing scenario simulated (i.e., global or hake-targeting fishing). Some indicators do not seem to be sensitive to fishing pressure (slope of the diversity size spectrum) or do not vary consistently with other studies (W statistic).},

  abstract = {There is now a strong scientific consensus that coastal marine systems of Western Europe are highly sensitive to the combined effects of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. However, it still remains challenging to assess the spatial and temporal scales at which climate influence operates. While large-scale hydro-climatic indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or the East Atlantic Pattern (EAP) and the weather regimes such as the Atlantic Ridge (AR), are known to be relevant predictors of physical processes, changes in coastal waters can also be related to local hydro-meteorological and geochemical forcing. Here, we study the temporal variability of physical and chemical characteristics of coastal waters located at about 48\textdegree N over the period 1998\textendash 2013 using (1) sea surface temperature, (2) sea surface salinity and (3) nutrient concentration observations for two coastal sites located at the outlet of the Bay of Brest and off Roscoff, (4) river discharges of the major tributaries close to these two sites and (5) regional and local precipitation data over the region of interest. Focusing on the winter months, we characterize the physical and chemical variability of these coastal waters and document changes in both precipitation and river runoffs. Our study reveals that variability in coastal waters is connected to the large-scale North Atlantic atmospheric circulation but is also partly explained by local river influences. Indeed, while the NAO is strongly related to changes in sea surface temperature at the Brest and Roscoff sites, the EAP and the AR have a major influence on precipitations, which in turn modulate river discharges that impact sea surface salinity at the scale of the two coastal stations.},

The phenomenon arises because of the coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean interactions whereby the winds create changes in sea temperatures that in turn determine where the main tropical convection and storm activity occur, and thus determine the winds. This article outlines the current understanding of ENSO and the physical connections between the tropical Pacific and the rest of the world, using the 1997\textendash 98 El Ni\~no event as a particular illustration. The mechanisms are described along with the interannual variations in climate over time and the associated El Ni\~no events. The impacts are described especially in terms of the associated floods and droughts around the world. An update is included to encompass the super El Ni\~no event of 2015\textendash 16.},

  abstract = {El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) encompasses variability in both the eastern and western tropical Pacific. During the warm phase of ENSO, the eastern tropical Pacific is characterized by equatorial positive sea surface temperature (SST) and negative sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies, while the western tropical Pacific is marked by off-equatorial negative SST and positive SLP anomalies. Corresponding to this distribution are equatorial westerly wind anomalies in the central Pacific and equatorial easterly wind anomalies in the far western Pacific. Occurrence of ENSO has been explained as either a self-sustained, naturally oscillatory mode of the coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere system or a stable mode triggered by stochastic forcing. Whatever the case, ENSO involves the positive ocean\textendash atmosphere feedback hypothesized by Bjerknes. After an El Ni\~no reaches its mature phase, negative feedbacks are required to terminate growth of the mature El Ni\~no anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific. Four requisite negative feedbacks have been proposed: reflected Kelvin waves at the ocean western boundary, a discharge process due to Sverdrup transport, western Pacific wind-forced Kelvin waves, and anomalous zonal advections. These negative feedbacks may work together for terminating El Ni\~no, with their relative importance being time-dependent. ENSO variability is most pronounced along the equator and the coast of Ecuador and Peru. However, the eastern tropical Pacific also includes a warm pool north of the equator where important variability occurs. Seasonally, ocean advection seems to play an important role for SST variations of the eastern Pacific warm pool. Interannual variability in the eastern Pacific warm pool may be largely due to a direct oceanic connection with the ENSO variability at the equator. Variations in temperature, stratification, insolation, and productivity associated with ENSO have implications for phytoplankton productivity and for fish, birds, and other organisms in the region. Long-term changes in ENSO variability may be occurring and are briefly discussed. This paper is part of a comprehensive review of the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific.},

This analysis is done on data from September 1997, the start of data from the SeaWiFS satellite, through December 1999, a time period dominated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation. Four distinct biological responses are observed. The dominant response is a symmetric off-equatorial chlorophyll increase during La Ni\~na that extends between 2\textdegree{} and 18\textdegree{} latitude from the eastern Pacific to the date line. The chlorophyll mode is tightly correlated to SSH, suggesting that the chlorophyll increase is a result of the shoaling thermocline, which increases the surface nutrient supply. The better known equatorial decrease in chlorophyll during El Ni\~no is seen in a separate EOF mode. Using acoustic Doppler current profiler data from the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean/Triton array, it is shown that the cessation of the El Ni\~no equatorial chlorophyll minimum is tied to the recommencement of the iron-rich Equatorial Undercurrent which occurs several months prior to the termination of the El Ni\~no. There is an off-equatorial bloom during the peak of the El Ni\~no between 120\textdegree W-180\textdegree W and 8\textdegree N-15\textdegree N. This bloom occurs within the area covered by the previously mentioned La Ni\~na bloom, but it is more localized, and its fluctuations appear correlated with changes in the North Equatorial Counter Current. The shoaling thermocline in the western warm pool during El Ni\~no results in a chlorophyll bloom that extends from the Philippines to 155\textdegree E between 0\textdegree N and 15\textdegree N. This bloom terminates in unison with the end of the El Ni\~no when elevated SSH is reestablished in the western basin.},

However, the implementation of such integrated models has been limited due to lack of data, and their performance in advising fisheries management has been rarely evaluated. We developed an end-to-end model (OSMOSE-JZB) representing organisms of high and low trophic levels in the Jiaozhou Bay, a temperate bay in China with limited available data. We evaluated the performance of the model for simulating the ecosystem dynamics by comparing the model-predicted species biomass, size structure, trophic level, and mortality with relevant data derived from scientific surveys and literature. In general, the model-predicted species biomass and size ranges were consistent with observations. However, the size structure of the two dominant fish species showed some discrepancies between the model simulations and observations. The predicted mean trophic levels from OSMOSE-JZB were closer to the values derived from an Ecopath model of the same region, compared to the values derived from empirical isotope analysis. The model's output suggested that predation mortality appeared to be the main source of mortality for younger individuals compared to starvation and fishing mortality. This study suggests that the OSMOSE-JZB performs well under a data-poor situation and can be considered as a baseline ecosystem model for developing EBFM.},

  abstract = {A logistic production model was used to examine potential relationships between three climate indices, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Multivariate El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and productivity estimates of the North Pacific albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) population. Catch and standardized catch-per-unit-effort data from three longline fisheries (Japan, US, and Taiwan) were used in the model. The climate indices were incorporated into the model by correlating time-varying intrinsic population growth rate (ry) of the production model with the annual mean value for each index. The estimated probability that the NPGO is positively correlated with stock productivity, as measured by ry, was 0.99, and the calculated probability that MEI is negatively correlated with the productivity was 0.95. The time lag for these correlations is 4 yr, which is consistent with the timing of recruitment to the Japan longline fishery. The PDO did not seem to have any detectable relationship with stock productivity. However, it remains uncertain if there is a conclusive linkage between the albacore productivity and the NPGO or the MEI index, because model fit to the data is about the same as that of a base model which does not use any climate index and assumes a time-invariant r.},
